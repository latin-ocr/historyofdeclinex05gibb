h—v-—1 the most ancient map of Ruffia affords some places which still retain

their name and position3 and the two caphals, Novogorod ⁵⁰ and
Kiow ⁵¹, are coeval with the first nge of the monarchy. Novogorod
had not yet deserved the epithet of great, nor the alliance of the
Hanseatic lengue, which diffused the streains of opulence and the
principles of freedom. Kiow could not yet boast of three hun-
dred churches, an innumerable people, and a degree of greatness
and splendour, which was compared with Constantinople by those
who had never seen the refidenee of the Caesars. In their origin,
the two cities were no more than camps or fairs, the most convenient
stations in which the Barbarians might affemble for the occafional
bufiness of war or trade. Yet even these affemblies announce some
progress in the arts of society3 a new breed of cattle was imported
from the southern provinces; and the spirit of commercial enter—
prise pervaded the sea and land from the Baltie to the Euxine, from'

the mouth of the Oder to the port of Constantinople. In the days
of idolatry and barbarism, the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented

and enriched by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free

mart of purchase and exchange ⁵².

⁵0 The haughty proverb, ‘¹ who can re-
“ fist God and the great Novogorod?'' is
applied by M. Leveque (Hist. de Ruffie,
tomi. p.6o>) even to the times that pre-
ceded the reign of Ruric. In the course of his
history 116 frequently celebrates this republic,
which was suppress‘ed A.D. 1473 (tom. ii.
p. 252—266.). Thataccurate traveller, Adam
Olearius,describes (in 1635) the remain of No-
vogorod, and the route by sea andland ofihe
Holiiekn ambassadors (tom.i. p. 123—129.).
