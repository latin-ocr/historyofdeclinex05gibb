throne, and from the throne to the convent. A distant and danger—
ous station, amidst the Barbarians of the West, excited the spirit and
freedom of the Latin bilhops. Their popular election endeared them
to the Romans: the public and private indigence was relieved by
their ample revenue ; and the weakness or neglect of the emperors
compelled them to consult, both in peace and war, the temporal

Greek, or the Syriam, who ascended the chair of St. Peter3 and, after
the loss of her legions and provinces, the genius and fortune of the
popes again restored the supremacy of Rome. It is agreed, that in
the eighth century their dominion was founded on rebellion, and
that the rebellion was produced, and justified, by the heresy of the
