of the confederates. A tempest of wind, rain, and hail, overturned C H Α Ρ.
their tents: their private quarrels were fomented by an infidious ad· μέμ-ρ

to subvert the throne, or to check the conquests, of their invincible

exile¹³ 4.
The choice of Jerusalem for the first kebla of prayer, discovers the

early propenfity of Mahomet in favour of the Jews3 and happy
would it have been for their temporal interest, had they recog-
nised, in the Arabian prophet, the hope of Israel and the promised
Meffiah. Their obstinacy converted his friendship into implacable
hatred, with which he pursued that unfortunate people to the last
moment of his life : and in the double charaeter of an apostle and a
conqueror, his persecution was extended to both worlds¹³⁵. The
Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the protection of the city; he seized
the occasion of an accidental tumult, and summoned them to em-
brace his religion, or contend with him in battle. ‘⁶ Alas‚” replied
the trembling Jews, “ we are ignorant of the use of arms, but we

“ persevere in the faith and worihip of our fathers ; why wilt thou
“ reduce us to the neceffity of a just defence?'' The unequal con-

fii& was terminated in fifteen days3 and it was with extreme reluc-

tance that Mahomet yielded to the importunity of his allies, and con-
sented to spare the lives of the captives. But their riches were con-
fiscated, their arms became more effeetual in the hands of the Musul-

mans3 and a wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven with
their wives and children to implore a refuge on the confines of Syria.
