THE DECLINE AND FALL

in Armenia and Cappadocia3 and this innocent allegory revived the

example and memory of the first ages. In the gospel, and the
epistles of St. Paul, his faithful follower investigated the creed of
primitive Christianity; and, whatever might be the success, a pro-
testant reader will applaud the spirit, of the enquiry. But if the
scriptures of the Paulicians were pure, they were not perfect. Their
founders rejected the two epistles of St. Peter ⁴, the apostle of the
circumcision‚ whose dispute with their favourite for the observance of

the law could not easily be forgiven ⁵. They agreed with their

Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt for the Old Testament,
the books of Moses and the prophets‚ which have been consecrated
by the deci-ees of the Catholic church. With equal boldness, and
doubtless with more reason, Constantine, the new Sylvanus‚ dis-
claimed the vifions, which, in so many bulky and splendid volumes‚
had been published by the Oriental sects⁶ ; the fabulous productioris
of the Hebrew patriarchs and the fages of the East 3. the spurious
gospels‚ epistles, and acts, which in the first age had overwhelmed
the orthodox code3 the theology of Manes, and the authors of the
kindred herefies; and the thirty generations, or aeons, which had
been created by the fruitful fancy of Valentine. The Paulicians
fincerely condemned the memory and opinions of the Mani-
chaean sect, and complained of the injustice which impreffed that
invidious name on the simple votaries of St. Paul and of Christ.

Peter, the Paulicians are justified by some of
the most respectable of the ancients and mo-
derns (see Wetstein ad loc. Simon, Hist.
Critique du Nouveau Testament‚ c.17.).
They likewise overlooked the Apocalypse
(Petr. Sicul. p. 756.); but as such neglect is
not imputed as a crime, the Greeks of the
ἦλθ’ century must have been careless of the
credit and honour of the Revelations.

⁵ This contentiori, which has not escaped

the malice of Porphyry, supposes some error
and paffion in one or both of the apostles. By
Chrysostom, Jerom, and Erasmus, it is re-
presented as a stiam quarrel, a pious fraud,
sor the benefit of the Gentiles and the cor-
reffion ofthe Jews (Middleton’s Works, vol. ii.

p. 1—-zo>).
