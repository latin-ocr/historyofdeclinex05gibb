OF THE ROM-AN EMPIRE. 417

Ommiades‚ a royal youth of the name of Abdalrahman alone escaped C 1}le Ρ-

the rage of his enemies, who hunted the wandering exile from the μ--ν-..ι
banks of the Euphrates to the vallies of mount Atlas. His presence
in the neighbourhood of Spain revived the zeal of the white faition.
The name and cause of the Abbaffides had been first vindicated by
the Perfians : the West had been pure from civil arms ; and the ser-
vants of the abdicated family still held, by a precarious tenure, the
inheritance of their lands and the offices of government. Strongly
prompted by gratitude‚ indignation, and fear, they invited the grand-
son of the caliph Hassiem to ascend the throne of his ancestors ; and
in his desperate condition, the extremes of rashness and prudence
were almost the same. The acclamations of the people saluted his
landing on the coast of Andalufia3 and, after a successful struggle,
Abdalrahman established the throne of Cordova, and was the father
of the Ommiades of Spain, who reigned above two hundred and

fifty years from the Atlantic to the Pyrenees ³⁹. He ssew in battle a
lieutenant of the Abbaffides‚ who had invaded his dominions with a
fleet and army: the head of Ala, in salt and camphire, was sus-
pended by a daring meffenger before the palace of Mecca ; and the
caliph Almansor rejoiced in his safety‚ that he was removed by seas
and lands from such a formidable adversary. The'rs mutual defigns
or declarations of offenfive war evaporated without effeet3 but in-
stead of opening a door to the conquest of Europe, Spain was dis-
severed from the trunk of the monarchy, engaged in perpetual hos-
tility with the East, and inclined to peace and friendlhip with the
Christian sovereigns of Constantinople and France. The example of Tripte divi-

the Ommiades was imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali, ἓξιῗρέἓεὲθ
