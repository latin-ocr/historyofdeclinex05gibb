OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

dukes of Poland and Bohemia‚ confeffed themselves his tributary
vaffals. At the head of a vietorious army, he paffed the Alps, sub-
dued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the pope, and for ever fixed
the Imperial crown in the name and nation of Germany. From

that memorable aera, two maxims of public jurisprudence were in-
troduced by force and ratified by time. Ι. That the prince, who was
elected in the German diet, acquired from that instant the subject
kingdoms of Italy and Rome. II. But that he might not legally
assume the titles of emperor and Augustus, till he had received the
crovvn from the hands of the Romanrpontiffm'.

The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the East
by the alteration of his style 3 and instead of saluting his fathers, the
Greek emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and fami-
liar appellation of brother ¹²⁰. Perhaps in his conneffion with Irene
he aspired to the name of husband: his embaffy to Constantinople
spoke the language of peace and friendship, and might conceal a
treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess, who had renounced
the most sacred duties of a mother. The nature, the duration, the
probable consequences of such an union between two distant and
dissonant empires, it is impossible to conjetsture3 but the unanimous
silence of the Latins may teach us to suspect, that the report was in-
vented by the enemies of Irene, to charge her with the gnilt of he-
*traying the chureh and state to the strangers of the XVestm. The
