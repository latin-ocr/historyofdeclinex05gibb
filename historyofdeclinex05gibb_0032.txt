28 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Cxffvsinf'· though popular declaration, that hc would in all things avoid the
·-¹--w-·ss‘ example of his father. On the near prospect of his decease, Mhzhael,
the great master of the palace‚ and the husband of his sister procopia,
was named by every person of the palace and city, except by his
envious brother. Tenacious of a sceptre now falling from his hand,-
he conspired against the life of his successor, and cherished the idea
of changing to a democracy the Roman empire. But these rash„
projects served only to inflame the zeal of the people and to remove·
the scruples of the candidate : Michael the first accepted the purple5.
and before he sunl< into the grave, the son of Nicephorus implored-
Mzchaell. the clemency of his new sovereign. Had Michael in an age of
ᾖξ’ῗξῗὲῗῖζ peace ascended an hereditary throne, he might have reigned and
0ss⁰b⁶¹ ²· died the father of his people: but his mild virtues were adapted to
the shade of private life, nor was he capable of controlling the am-
bition of his equals, or of refisting the arms of the victorious Bul-⁷
garians. While his want of ability and success exposed him to the-
contempt of the soldiers, the masculine spirit of his wife Procopio..
awakened their indignation. Even the Greeks of the ninth cen-
tury were provoked by the insolence of a female, who, in the fronto
of the standards, presumed to direct their discipline and animate
their valour3 and their licentious clamours advised the new Semi-
ramis to reverence the majesty of a Roman camp. After an unsuc-
cessful campaign, the emperor left in their winter-quarters of Thrace„
a disaffected army under the command of his enemies; and their*
artful eloquence persuaded the soldiers to break the dominion of the
eunuchs‚ to degrade the husband of Procopia, and to affert the
right of a military election. They marched towards the capital:
yet the clergy, the senate, and the people of Constantinople, adhered
to the cause of Michael ; and the troops and treasures of Afia might
have protracted the mischiefs of civil war. But his humanity (by
the ambitious, it will be termed his weakness) protessed, that not a

drop.
