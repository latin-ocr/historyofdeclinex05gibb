months, the three hundred and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and
subscribed an unanimous decree, that all vifible symbols of Christ,
except in the Eucharist‚ were either blasphemous or heretieal; that
image-worship was a corruption of Christianity and a renewal of
Paganism ; that all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or
erazed 3 and that those who should refuse to deliver the· objecis of
their private superstition, were guilty of disobedience to the authority
of the church and of the emperor. In their loud and loyal acela-

ritual censures. At Constantinople‚ as in the former councils, the
will of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith ; but on this occa-

crificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and fear.
