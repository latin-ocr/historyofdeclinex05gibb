THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 11 Α P. the experieucc of history exalts and cnlarges the horizon of our in-

x--v—-J tellectual view. Iu a composition of spine days, in a perusal of some

hours, fix hundred years have rolled away, and the duration of a
life or reign is eontraded to a sseeting moment: the grave is ever
befide the throne ; the success of a criminal is almost instantly fol-
lowed by the loss of his prize ; and our immortal reason survives and
disdains the fixty phantoms of kings who have paffed before our
eyes, and faintly dwell on our remembrance. The observation, that,
in every age and climate, ambition has prevailed with the same
commanding energy, may abate the surprise of a philosopher3 but
while he condemns the vanity‚ he may search the motive‚ of this
universal defire to obtain and hold the sceptre of dominion. To
the greater part of the Byzantine serie& we cannot reasonably ascribe
the love of fame and of mankind. The virtue alone of John Com·
uenus was beneficent and pure: the most illustrious of the princes,
who precede or follow that respectable name, have trod with some
dexterity and vigour the crooked and bloody paths of a selfish po-
licy: in scrutinizing the imperfe& charaeters of Leo the Isaurian,
Bafil the first, and Alexius Comnenus, of Theophilus, the second
Bam, and Manuel Comnenus, our esteem and censure are almost
equally balanced3 and the remainder of the Imperial crowd could
only desire and expe& to be forgotten by posterity. Was personal
happiness the aim and object of their ambition ἓ Ι shall not descant
on the vulgar topics of the misery of kings; but I may surely ob-
serve, that their condition, of all others, is the most pregnant with
fear, and the least susceptible of hope. For these oppofite passions,
a larger scope was allowed in the revolutions of antiquity‚ than in
the smooth and solid temper of the modern world, which cannot
easily repeat either the triumph of Alexander or the fall of Darius..
