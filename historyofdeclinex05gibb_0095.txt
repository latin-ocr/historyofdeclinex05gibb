the superstitious mind was more easily reconcilcd to paint and to
worship the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the hu-
man ssmpe, which, on earth, they have condescended to assume.
The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and
mortal body; but that body had ascended into heaven 3 and, had not
’ some fimilitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples‚ the spiri-
tual worssiip of Christ might have been obliterated by the vifible re-
lies and representations of the saints. A fimilar ‘indulgence was re-
quifite, and propitious, for the Virgin Mary: the place of her buria}
was unknown 5 and the assumption of her sou] and body into hea-
ven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks and Latins. The
use, and even the worship, of images, was firmly established before
the end of the fixth century: they were fondly cherished by the
warm imagination of the Greeks and Afiatics: the Pantheon and
Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition3
but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the
rude Embarians and the Arian clergy of the West. The bolder
forms of sculptu1e,'1n brass or marble, which peopled the temples of
antiquiry‚ were offenfive to the fancy or conscience of the Christian
Greeks3 and a smooth surface of colours has ever been esteemed a
more decent and harmless mode of imitation ⁶.
