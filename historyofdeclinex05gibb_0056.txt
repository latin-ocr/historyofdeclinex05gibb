52 THE DECLINE AND FALL

CXffVfiIP- the death of an unpopular prince was forgiven 3 and the guilt of
x--qf—ssae Zimisces was forgotten in the splendour of his virtues. Perhaps his
profufion was less useful to the state than the avarice of Nicephorus;
but his gentle and generous behaviour dclighted all who approached
his person; and it was only in the paths of victory that he trod in
the footsteps of his predecessor. The greatest part of his reign was
employed in the camp and the field: his personal valour and affl-

their patrimony was ably and faithfully administered ; and the pre-
mature death of Zimisces was a loss, rather than a benefit, to the sons
of Romanus. Their want of experience detained them twelve years
longer the obscure and voluntary pupils of a minister, who extended
his reign by persuading them to indulge the pleasures of youth, and
to disdain the labours of government. In this filken web, the weak-
