310 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΗΜΛ Ρ· The passion of a Syrian youth completed the ruin of the exiles of

«ψη-,ξι Damascus. A nobleman of the city, of the name of Jonas ⁶², was
ἓῗπΐιυέῗεῖξιῐεὲε betrothed to a wealthy1naiden3 but her parents delayed the con-
summation of his nuptials, and their daughter was persuaded to escape
with the man whom she had chosen. They corrupted the nightly
watchmen of the gate Kcisan: the lover, who led the way, was en-
compaffed by a squadron of Arabs ; but his exclamation in the
Greek ''tongue, “ the bird is taken,'’ admonished his mistress to
hasten her return. In the presence of Caled, and of death, the un·-
fortunate Jonas profeffed his belief in one God, and his apostle Ma-
homet3 and continued, till the season of his martyrdom, to discharge
the duties of a brave and sincere Musulman. When the city was taken,
he ssew to the monastery, where Eudocia had taken refuge3 but the
lover was forgotten; the apostate was scorned3 she preferred her religion
to her country3 and the justice of Caled, though deaf to mercy, re-
fused to detain by force a male or female inhabitant of Damascus. Four
days was the general confined to the city by the obligation of the treaty,
and the urgent cares of his new conquest. His appetite for blood
and rapine would have been extinguissied by the hopeless'computa-
tion of time and distance3 but he listened to the importunities of
Jonas, who affilred him that the weary fugitives might yet be over-
taken. At the head of four thousand· horse, in the disguise of
Christian Arabs, Calcd undertook the pursuit. They haltcd only for
the moments of prayer3 and their guide had a perfec‘t knowledge of
