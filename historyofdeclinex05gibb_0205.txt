01³ THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 201

v‘some fancy has been indulged in the political and philosophical οἷν· C Hx Α P·
servations which are ascribed to the Arabiam traveller ⁷¹. He com- fflL-...J
pares the nations and the religiosis of the earth ; discovers the wezil-b

indignation, the degeneracy of the times; and resolves to unite,
under one God and one king, the invincible spirit and primitive vir-

Bostra and Damascus: that he was only thirteen years of age when
he accompanied the caravan of his uncle, and ¹that his duty com-
pelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise
of Cadijah. In these hasty and superficial excurfions, the eye of
genius might discern some objects invifible to his groffer companions5
some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil 3 but his
ignorance of the Syriae language must have checked his curiofity3

annually ass'emffled, by the calls of devotion and commerce: in the
free concourse of multitudesffa simple citizen, in his native tongue‚
might study the political state and character of the tribes, the theory
and practice of the Jews and Christians. Some useful strangers
might be tempted‚ or forced, to implore the rights of hospitality3
and the enemies of Mahomet have named the Jew, the Persian, and
the Syrian monk, whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to
the composition of the Koran⁷². 2 Conversation enriches the under-
