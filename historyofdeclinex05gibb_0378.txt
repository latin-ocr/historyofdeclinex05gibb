374 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {LA P. Disdaining the confinement of their walls, they gave battle to the
W Arabs on the plain3 but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a
quarry, or a ruin, chastised their indiscretion and intercepted their
return. The wooden turrets of affault were rolled forwards to the
foot of the rampart3 but the defence of Merida was obstinate and
long ; and the afile qf' the marzjyrs was a perpetual testimony of·the
loffes of the Mossems. The constancy of the besieged was at length
subdued by famine and despair3 and the prudent vietor disguised his
impatience under the names of clemency and esteem. The alterna-
tive of exile or tribute was allowed3 the churches were divided be-
tween the two religions 3 and the wealth of those who had fallen in
the siege, or retired to Gallieia, was confiscated as the reward of the
faithful. In the midway between Merida and Toledo, the lieu-
tenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent of the caliph, and conducted
him to the palace of the Gothic kings. Their first interview was
cold and formal: a rigid account was exacted of the treasures of
Spain: the character of Tarik was exposed to suspicion and obloquy;
and the hero was imprisoned, reviled‚ and ignominioussy scourged
by the hand, or the command, of Musa. Yet so stri& was the dis-
cipline, so pure the zeal, or so tame the spirit, of the primitive Mos-
lerns, that, after this public indignity‚ Tarik could serve and be
trusted in the reduffion of the Tarragonese province. A mosch was
ere&ed at Saragoffa, by the liberality of the Koreish: the port of
Barcelona was opened to the veffels of Syria; and the Goths were
pursued beyond the Pyrenean mountains into their Gallie province of
Septimania or Languedoc¹⁸⁴. In the church of St. Mary at Car-
