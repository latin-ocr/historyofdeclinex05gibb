THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. of Herat will afford a lively conti-ast of private zeal and public tole-

§.av-J ration ²⁰².

Under the payment of an annual tribute, the Mahometan
law secured to the Ghebers of Hei-at, their civil and religious liber-
ties: but the recent and humble mosch was overssaadowed by the
antique splendour of the adjoining temple of fire. A fanatic Imam
deplored, in his sermons, the scandalous neighbourhood, and ac-
cused the weakness or indifference of the faithful. Excited by his
voice, the people assembled in tumult3 the two houses of prayer
were consumed by the flames, but the vacant ground was im-
mediately occupied by the foundations of a new mosch. The
injured Magi appealed to the sovereign of Chorasan; he promised
justice and relief; when, behold! four thousand citizens of Herm,
of a grave charaeta and mature age, unanimoussy swore that the
idolatrous fane had never existed3 the inquisition was filenced, and
their conscience was satisfied (says the historiari Mirehond) ²⁰³ with
this holy and meritorious perjury²⁰*. But the greatest part of the

Mamun confirms this honourable distinction de la Croix (Hist. de Genghizcan, p. 537,

 

in favour of the three sects, with the vague
and equivocal religion of the Sabaeans, under
which the ancient polytheists of Charrae were
allowed to ssielter their idolatrous worship
(Hottinger, Hist. Orient. p. 167, 168.).

²⁰² This singular story is related by d’I-Ier-
belot (Bibliot. Orient. p. 448, 449.) on the
saith of Kliondemir‚ and by Mirehond hirn-
self (Uist. priorum Regum Persarum, ἃς.
p. 9, ιο. not. p.88, 89.).

²0³ Mirehond(Mohammed EmirKhoondah
Shah), a native of Herat, composed in thc
Perfian language a general history of the
East, from the creation to the year of the
Hegira 875 (A. D. 1471). In the year 904
(A. D. 1498) the historian obtained the
command of a princely library‚ and his ap-
plaudcd work, in seven or twelve parts, was
abbreviated in three volumes by his son Rhon-
demir, A. H. 927. A. D. ¹520· The two
writers most accurately distinguished by Petit

538. 544, 545·)› are loosely confounded by

d'Herbelot (p. 358. 410. 994, 995.): but
his numerous extraeks, under the improper

name of Khondemir, belong to the father
rather than the son. The historiari of Gen-
ghizcan refers to a MS. of Mirchond, which
he received from the hands of his friend
d'Herbelot himself. A curious fragment
(the Taherian and Soffarian Dynasties) has
been lately publilhed in Perfic and Latin
(Viennae, 1782, in 4¹⁰, cum notis Bernard
de Jenisch); and the editor allows us to hope
sor a continuation of Mirehond.

²0⁴ Qo testimonio boni se quidpiam prae-
stitiss'e opinabantur. ⁷ Yet Mirchond must
have condemned their zeal, since he approved
the legal toleration of the Magi, cui (the

fire temple) perafilo singulis annis censu, uti
sacra Mohammcdis lege cautum, ab omnibus

molestiis ac oneribus libero effe licuit.
