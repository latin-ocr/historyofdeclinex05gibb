OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

glory of humbling the Greek arrogance, and of marking the path
of conquest to the navies of the W'est. He landed some soldiers to
rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and pointed with silves, or more
probably with fire, the arrows which he dischargcd against the
palace of the Caesars ¹¹¹. This playful outrage of the pirates of Sicily,
who had surprised an unguarded moment, Manuel affeeled to de-
spise, while his martial spirit, and the forces of the empire, were
awakened to revenge. The Archipelago and Ionian sea were co-
vered with his squadrons and those of Venice, but l know not by
what favourable allowance of transports, vicimum-5, and pinnaces,
our reason, or even our fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous
account of fifteen hundred vessels, which is proposed by a Byzantine
historian. These operations were dii-edred with prudence and energy:
in his homeward voyage, George lost nineteen of liis gallies, which
were separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, Corfu im-
plored the clemency of her lawful sovereign3 nor could a ¹ship, a

soldier of the Norman prince, be found, unless as a captive, within

the limits of the Eastern empire. The prosperity and the health of

Greeks and Latins as zhe Alexander or Hercules of the age.

A prince of such a temper could not be satisfieri with having re-
pelled the insolence of a Barbarian. It was the right and duty, it
might be the interest and glory, of Manuel to restore the ancient
majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of Italy and Sicily,
and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of a Norman

vaffal ¹¹². The natives of Calabria were still’attached to the Greek
