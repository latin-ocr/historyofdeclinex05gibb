perils, had reached the gates of Jerusalem were the victims of pri-

worship in the church of the resurrection was often disturbed by the
savage rudeness of its masters. The pathetic tale excited the mil-

relief of the holy land: and yet how trifiing is the sum of these accu-
mulated evils, if compared with the single a& of the sacrilege of
Hakem, which had been so patiently endured by the Latin Christians!

descendants: a new spirit had arisen of religious chivalry and papal
dominion: a nerve was touched of exquifite feeling3 and the seno
{atlon vibrated to the heart of Europe.
