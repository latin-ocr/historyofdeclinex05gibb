'subduIng the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed to follow the C H A Ρ
course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine sea, to over· i...,L¹.'- ,

throw the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, and returning

from Europe to Asta, to unite his new acquifitions with Antioch
and the provinces of Syriam.
“easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar minds 3 and

the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his dependence and
servitude. The friends of Tarik had effectually stated his services

and wrongs: at the court of Damascus, the proceedings of Musa
were blamed, his intentions were suspected, and his delay in corn-

Gothic nobles, with gold coronets and girdles‚ were distinguished in
his train ; and the number of male and female captives, selected
for their birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at
