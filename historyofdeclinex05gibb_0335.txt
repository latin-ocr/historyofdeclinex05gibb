republic with the materials and the subje& of a trophy. A gigantic
statue of Apollo or the sun, seventy cubits in height, was erthed at.

arts of Greece. After standing fifty-fix years, the coloffus os Rhodes
was overthrown by an earthquaket but the massy trunk, and huge
fragments, lay scattered eight centuries on the ground, and are often
