the palladium of the state: the gallies and artillery might occafionally

was concealed with the most jealous scruple, and the terror of the
enemies was encreased and prolonged by their ignorance and surprise.
In the treatise of the administration of t'he empire, the royal author²⁸
suggests the answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet
curiosxty and importunate demands of the Barbarians. They should
be told that the nrystery of the Greek fire had been revealed‘ by
an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines, with a sacred
injund'tion, that this gift of heaven, this peculiar bleffing of the Ro-
mans, should never be communicated to any foreign nation: that
the prince and subje& were alike bound to religious filence under the
temporal and spir'nual penalties of treason and saerilege; and that
the impious attempt would provoke the sudden· and' supernaturzd
vengeanee of the God of the Ch-ristians. By these precautions, the
secret was confined‚ above fou-r hundred years, to the Romans of the
East ; and, at the end of the eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom
every sea and every art were familiar, suffered the effeets, without
understanding the compofition, of the Greek f1re. It was at length
either discovered or stolen by the Mahometans; and, in the holy
wars of Syria and Egypt, they retorted an invention, contrived
against themselves, on the hcads of the Christians. A knight, who
despised the sxvords and lances os the Saraccns, relates, with heartfelt
