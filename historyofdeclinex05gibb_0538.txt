THE DECLINE AND FALL

{ion of twenty-seven years, Sylvanus, who had retired from the εον
lerating government of the Arabs, fell a sacrifice to Roman persecu-
tion. The laws of the pious emperors, which seldom touched the
lives of less odious heretics, proscribed without mercy or disguise the
tenets, the books, and the persons of the R‘lontanists and Mani-
ehaeans: the books were delivered to the ssames3 and all who should
presume to secrete such writings, or to profess such opinions, were
devoted to an ignominious death ¹⁴. A Greek minister, armed with
legal and military powers, appeared at Colonia to strike the snep-
herd, and to reclaim, ispoffible, the lost sheep. By a refluement of
cruelty‚ Simeon placed the unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of
his disciples, who were commanded, as the price of their pardon and
the proof of their repentance, to maffacre their spiritual father. They
turned assde from the impious office3 the stones dropt from their
silial hands, and of the whole number, only one executioner could
be found, a new David, as he is styled by the Catholics, who boldly
overthrew the giant of heresy. This apostate, Justus was his name,
again deceived and betrayed his unsuspec‘ting brethren‚ and a new
conformity to the aeis of St. Paul may be found in the converslon of
Simeon: like the apostle, he embraced the doctrine which he had
been sent to persecute, renounced his honours and fortunes, and
acquired among the Paulicians the fame ofa missionary and a martyr.
They were not ambitious of martyrdom¹⁵, but in a calamitous period
of one hundred and fifty years, their patience sustained whatever
