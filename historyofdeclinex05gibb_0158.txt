THE DECLINE ΑΝΙ) FALL

C H A P. ages¹³⁰ the fable ¹³¹ of a female pope ¹³². The bastard son, the grand-

XLIX.

u-v-2 son and the great-grandson of Mamzia, a rare genealog-y, were seated

in the chair of St. Peter, and it was at the'age of nineteen years that
the second of these became the head of the Latin church. His youth
and manhood were of a suitable complexion ; and the nations of
pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges that were urged against
him in a Roman synod, and in the presence of Otho the great. As
John XII. had renou'nced the dress and decencies of his profession,
the soldier may not perhaps be dishonoured by the wine which he
drank‚ the blood that he spilt, the flames that he kindled, or the li-
centious pursuits of gaming and hunting. His open fimony might
be the consequence of distress: and his blasphemous invocation of
Jupiter and Venus, if it be true, could not poffibly be serious. But
we read with some surprise, that the worthy grandson of Marozia
lived in public adultery with the matrons of Rome3 that the Lateran

contemporary Anastasius indissolubly links the
death of Leo and the elevation of Benedici
(illico, mox, p. 247.) ; and the accurate chro-
nology of Pagi, Mummi, and Leibnitz, fixes
both events to the year 857.

¹³⁰ The advocates for pope Joan produce
one hundred and fifty whneffes, or rather
echceS, of the xivth, xxm, and xvith centu-
ries. They bear testimony against thern-
selves and the legend, by multiplying the
proos that so curious a story must have been
repeated by writers of every description to
whom it was known. On those os the ix‘h
and >1²¹¹ centuries, the recent event would
have flashed with a double force. Would
Photius have spared such a reproach? Could
Liutprand have miffed such scandal? It is
scarcely woith while to discuss the various
readings of Martinus PoIouus, Sigebert of
Gemblours‚ or even Marianus Scotus3 but
a most palpable forgery is the passage of
pope Joan‚' which has been foisted into some
MSS. and editions of the Roman Anastasius.

¹³¹ As falfi, it deserves that name; but I
would not pronounce it incredible. Suppose
a famous French chevalier of our own times
to have been born in Italy, and educated in
the chureh, instead of the army: her merit or
fortune might have raised her to St. Peter’s
chair; her amours would have been natural;
her delivery in the streets uulucky‚ but not
improbable.

'³² Till the reformation, the tale was re-
peated and believed without offence; and ·
Joan's female statue long occupied her place
among the popes in the cathedral of Sienna
(Pagi, Critica, tom. iii. p. 624-626.). She
has been annihilated by two learned protest-
ants,Blondel and Bnyle (Dit‘lionaire Critique,
Pirrssr, Ροιοκυ5, ΒιοΝοει); but their
brethren were scandalised by this equitable
and gener-ons criticism. Spanheim and Len-
sant attempt to save this poor engine of con-
troversy; and even Mosheim condescends to
cherish some doubt and suspicion (p. 289.).
