were intermingled, and the holy groves of Curland are stlid to have
been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold ⁵³. Between the sea
and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered; in the summer,
through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable river ; in the winter season,
over the hard and level surface of boundless snows. From the
neighbourhood of that city, the Ruffians descended the streams that
fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a single tree, were latlen
with ssaves of every age, fui-s of every species, the spoil of their
hee-hives‚ and the hides of their cattle3 and the whole produce of the
North was colleC’oed and discharged in the magazines of Kiow. The
mouth of June was the ordinary season of the departure of the fleetz
the timber of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches of
more solid and capacious boats; and they proceeded without ob·-
stacle down the Borysthenes, as far as the seven or thirteen ridges of
rocks, which traverse the bed, and precipitate the Walters, of the
river. At the more shallow falls it was sufficient to lighten the veffels;
but the deeper catarafflgs were impaffable3 and the mariners, who

of which he gives the Ruffian and Sclamnic
names; but thirteen are enumerated by tlte
