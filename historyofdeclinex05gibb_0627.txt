his person and palace3 and bequeathed to his successors the inhe-
ritance of their faith and valour⁷⁰. The name of a Norman in-

vader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with
alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in Epirus,
“ the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings. The Va-
rangians were supported by some companies of Franks or Latin83
and the rebels, who had fied to Constantinople from the tyranny of
Guiscard, were eager to fignalise their zeal and gratify their revenge.
In this emergency the emperor had not disdained the impure aid of
the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and Bulgaria ς and these
heretics united with the patience of martyrdom‚ the spirit and dis-
cipline of active valour ⁷¹. The treaty with the sultan had procured
a supply of some thousand Turks3 and the arrows of the Scythian
horse were opposed to the lances of the Norman cavalry. On the
report and distant prospect of these formidable numbers, Robert
affembled a council of his principal officers. “ You behold,'' said
he, “ your danger: it is urgent and inevitable. The hills are co-
“ vered with arms and standards; and the emperor of the Greeks
“ is accustomed to wars and triumphs. Obedience ‚and union are our
“ only safety3 and I arn ready to yield the command to a more
“ worthy leader.” The vote and acclamation, even of his secret
enemies, assured him, in that perilous moment, of their esteem and
confidence3 and the duke thus continued: “ Let us trust in the re-

“ wards of victory, and deprive cowardice of the means of escape.
