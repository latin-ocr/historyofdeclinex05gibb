278 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C }i„1A Ρ· these favourites of heavcn²; and they employed several days in

emi-..a mystic and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his Koran, 01·
book, is yet extant³3 and, in the pride of his mission, Mosellama
condescendcd to offer a partition of the earth. The proposal was
answered by Mahomet with contempt; but the rapid progress of the
impostor awakened the fears of his succeffor: forty thousand Mollems
were affembled under the standard of Caled ; and the existence
of their faith was resigned to the event of a decifive battle. In the
first aetion, they were repulsed with the loss of twelve hundred men;
but the skill and perseverance of their general prevailed : their defeat
was avenged by the ssaughter of ten thousand infidels; and Moseilama
himself was pierced by an Ethiopian ssave with the same javelin
which had mortally wounded the uncle of Mahomet. The various
rebels of Arabia, without a chief or a cause, were speedily suppreffed
by the power and discipline of the rising monarehy3 and the whole
nation again profeffed‚ and more stedfastly held, the religion of the
Koran. The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exercise
for the restless spirit of the Saracens: their valour was united in the
prosecution of an holy war; and their enthufiasm was equally con-
firmed by opposition and vietory.

² Their first salutation may be transcribed‚ but cannot be transsated. It was thus that
Moseilama said or sung:

Surge tandem itaque strenue permolenda; nam stratus tibi thorus est.
Aut in propatulo tentorio fi velis, aut in abditiore cubiculo fi malis ;
Aut supinam te humi exporret‘tam fustigabO, fi velis, aut si malis manibus pedibusque
nixam.
Aut fi velis ejus (Priapi) gemino triente, aut fi malis totus veniam.
Imo, totus venito, O Apostole Dei clamabat foemina. Id ipsum dicebat
Moscilama mihi quoque suggessit Deus.

The prophetess Segjah, after the sall of her ³ See this text, which demonstrates a God
lover, returned to idolatry; bur, under the from the work of generation, in Abulphara-
reign of Moawiyah,ss1e became a masalman, gius (Specimen, Hist. Arabum, p. ¹3· and
