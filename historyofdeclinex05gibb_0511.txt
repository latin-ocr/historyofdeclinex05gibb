of armed men. The language of fignals, so clear and copious in μήπω

the naval grammar of the moderns‚ was imperfeffly express‘ed by
the various pofitions and colours of a commanding flag. In the
darkness of the night the same orders to chace, to attaek, to halt,
to retreat, to break, to form, were conveyed by the lights of the
'leading galley. By land, the fire signals were repeated from one
mountain to another3 a chain of eight stations commanded a space
of five hundred miles; and Constantinople in a few hours was ap-
prized of the hostile motione of the Saracens of Tarsus ⁷³. Some
estimare may be formed of the power of the Greek emperors, by the

curious and minute detail of the armament which was prepared for
the reduc‘tion of Crete. A fleet of one hundred and twelve gallies,

and seventy-five vessels of the Pamphyliam style, was equipped iu
the capital, the issands of the AEgaean sea, and the sea—ports of Asta,
hlacedonizn and Greece. It carried thirty-four thousand mariners,
seven thousand three hundred and forty soldiers, seven hundred Rus-

slans, and five thousand and eighty-seven lWardastes, whose fathers
had been transplanted from the mountains of Libanus. Their pay,

most probably of a mouth, was computed at thirty-four centenarics
of gold, about one hundred and thirty-six thousand pounds ster-
ling. Our fancy is bewildered by the endless recapitulation of arms

and engines, of clothes and linen, of bread for the men and forage'

for the horses, and of stores and utenfils of every description, in-
adequate to the conquest of a petty issand, but amply sufficient for

the establishment of a fiourissiing colony ⁷⁶. ' T}
