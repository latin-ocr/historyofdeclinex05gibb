mode of a capitation, and preferred with reason a proportion of '

taxes, deduc‘ted on every branch from the clear prosits of agriculture

and commerce. A third part of the tribute was appropriated to the

annual repairs of the dykes and canals, so effential to the public
welfare. Under his administration the fertility of Egypt supplied
the dearth of Arabia3 and a string of eamels, laden with corn and
provision5‚ covered almost without an interval the long road from
Memphis to Medina ¹²⁶. But the genius of Amrou soon renewed the
maritime communication which had been attempted or atchieved
by the Pharaohs, the Ptolemies, or the Caesars; and a canal, at least
eighty miles in length, was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea.
This inland navigation, which would have joined the Mediterranean
