robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of the affeffment and
the standard of the metal. On the fide of the East the Hungarians
were opposed in doubtful confli& by the equal arms of the Bulga·
rians, whose saith forbfitde an alliance with the Pagans, and whose
situation formed the barrier of the Byzantine empire. The barrier
was overturned3 the emperor of Constantinople beheld the waving
banners of the Turks3 and one of their boldest warriors presumed
to strike a battle-axe into the golden gate. The arts and treasures
of the Greeks diverted the affault3 but the Hungarians might boast
in their retreat, that they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bul-
garia and the majesty of the Caesars ³⁴. The remote and rapid ope-
rations of the same campaign, appear to magnify the power and
numbers of the Turk53 but their courage is most deserving of praise,
since a light troop of three or four hundred horse would often at-
tempt and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of Theffa-
Ionica and Constantinople. At this disastrous aera of the ninth and
tenth centuries‚ Europe was affliCted by a triple scourge from the
North, the East‚ and the South: the Nox-man, the Hungarian‚ and
