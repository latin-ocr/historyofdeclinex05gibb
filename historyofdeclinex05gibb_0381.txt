world‚theinformations which their high mightineffes have
received from time to time, from the East Indies, are di„

plaints which the director-e, of the East India company
have addreffed to their high mightineffes‚ and which the
love of peace has made thern stifle in their bosonis, are
incontestable proofs of it. And the mensures taken with
