17² THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HLA P. and luxuriant herhage3 and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of
z--N comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life. But in the
dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless level of sand is intersedlcd by
iharp and naked mountains3 and the face of the desert, without
ssiade 01· molter, is scorched by the dire& and intense mys of a tro-
pical sun. Instead of refrelhing breezes, the winds, particularly
from the south-west, diffuse a noxious and even deadly vapour5 the
hillocks of saud which they alternately raise aud ·scatter, are cotn-
pared to the billows of the ocean, and whole caravssins, whole armies,
have been lost and buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits
of water are an objest of delire and contest3 and such is the scarcity
of wood, that some art is requifite to preserve and propagate the ele-
ment of fire. Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers, which fertilize
the soil, and convey its produce to the adjacent regions: the torrents
that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty earth ε the rarev and
hardy plants‚ the tamarind or the acacia, that strike their roots into
the clefts of the rocks, are nourished by the dews of the night: a
scanty supply of rain is collected in cisterns and aqueduCis: the
wells and springs are the secret treasure of the desert; and the pil.
grim of Mecca ⁵, after many a dry and sultry march, is disgusted by
the taste of the waters, which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or
salt. Such is the general and genuine picture of the climate of
Arabia. The experience of evil enhances the value of any local or
partial enjoyments. A ihady grove, a green pasture, a stream of
fresh water, are sufficient to attra& a colony of sedentary Arabs to
the fortunate spots which can ass'ord food and refrelhment to them-
selves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry in the
cultivation of the palin-trec and the vine. The high lands that border
on the Indian ocean are distinguizhed by their superior plenty of
