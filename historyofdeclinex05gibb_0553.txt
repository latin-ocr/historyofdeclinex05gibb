NDER the reign of Constantine the grandson of Heraclius, C HVA P.
the ancient barrier of the Danube, so often violated and so ι-Ὓ--Δ

often restored, was irletrievably swept away by a new deiuge of
Barbarians. Their progrels was favoni-ed by the caliphs, their un-
known and accidental auxiliaries: the Roman legions were occupied
in Afia3 and after the loss of Syria, Egypt, and Africa, the Caesars
were twice reduced to the danger and disgrace of defending their
capital against the Saracens. If in the account of this interesting
people, I have deviated from the stri& and original line of my un-
dertaking, the merit of the subje& will hide my transgreffion or so-
licit my excuse. In the East, in the West, in war, in religion, in
science, in their prosperity, and in their decay, the Arabians press
themselves on our curiosity: the first overthrow of the church and
empire of the Greeks may be imputed to their arm33 and the dis-
ciples of Mahomet still hold the civil and religione sceptre of the
Oriental world. But the same labour would be unworthily bestowed
on the swarms of savages, who, between the seventh and the twclfth
century, deseended from the plains of Scythia, in transient in-

road.
