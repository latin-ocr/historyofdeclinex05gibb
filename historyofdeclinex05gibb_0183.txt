‘OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

vour of the posterity of Ismael ²¹. Some exceptions, that can neither C HLA i'·

be difl'embled nor eluded, render this mode of reasoning as indiscrcet k--vss 1
as it is superfluous: the kingdom of Yemen has been successively

subdued by the Abyffinians, the Perfians, the sultans of Egypt ²²,

and the Turks ²³ ι

the holy cities of Mecca and Medina have re-

peatedly bowed under a Scythiam tyrant ; and the Roman province
of Arabia ²* embraced the peculiar wilderness in which Ismael and
his sons must have pitched their rents in the face of their brethren.
Yet these exceptions are temporary or local 3 the body of the nation

-hassfscape‘d the yoke of the most powerful monarchies: the arms of

Sesostris and Cyrus, of Pompey and Trajan, could never atchieve
the conquest of Arabia3 the present sovereign of the Turks²⁵ may
exercise a shadow of jurisdictiom but his pride is reduced to solicit
the friendship of a people, whom it is dangerous to provoke and
fruitless to attack. The obvious causes of their freedom are inscribed

²¹ A nameless doetor (Universal Hist. vol.
xx. octavo edition) has formally demonstrated
the truth of Christianity by the independence
os the Arabs. A critic, befides the excep-
tions of stiffi, might dispute the meaning of
the text (Genes. xvi. 12.), the extent of the
application‚ and the foundation of the pe-
digree.

²² It was subdued, A. D. 1173, by a bro-
ther of the great Saladin, who founded a
dynastyof Curds or Ayoubites (Guignes, Hist.
des Huns, tom. i. p. 425. D’Herbelot‚
P· 477·)-

¹338) and Selim ΙΙ. (1568). See Cantemir's
Hist. of the Othan empire, p. 201. 221.
The Paffia, who refided at Saana, commanded
twenty-one Beys, bnt no revenue was ever
remitted to the Forte (Mariigh, Stato Mi·
litare dell’ Imperio Ottomanno, p. ¹2÷·)› and
the Turks were expelled about the year 1630
(Niebuhr. p. 167, 168.).

²⁴ Of the Roman province, under the name
of Arabia and the third Palestiue, the princi-

pal cities were Bostra and Petra, which dated
their aera from the year 105, when they were
subdued by Palma a lieutenant of Trajan
(Dion Caffius, }.1xx=iii.). Petra was the capital
of the Nabathaeans; whose name is derived
from the eldest of the sons of ismael (Genes.
xxv. 12, &c. with the Commentaries ofJer0m‚
Le Clerc, and Calmet). Justinian relin-
quished a palm country of ten daysjourney to
the south of AElah (Procop. de Bell. Persic.
l. i. c. 19.), and the Romans maintained a
centurion and a custom-house (Arriam in Pe-
riplo Maris Erythran, p. ι r. in Huds0n‚
tom. i.), at a place (ms-„m ›ze-m, Pagus Albus
Hawara) in the territory of Medina (d'An-
ville Memoire sur I'Egypte, p. 243). These
real poss'essions, and some naval inroads of
Trajan (Peripl. p. 14, 15.), are magnifieri by
history and medals into the Roman conquest
of Arabia.

²⁵ Niebuhr (Description de J’Arabie, p.
302, 303. 329—331.) affords the most recent
and authentic intelligence of the Turkiffi em-
pire in Arabia.
