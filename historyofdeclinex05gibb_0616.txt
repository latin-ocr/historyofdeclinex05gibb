dom, under the rhadow of the Byzantine empire. Among the new
acquisitione of Guiscard, the science of Salerno⁴⁷‚ and the trade of
Amalphi⁴⁸‚ may detain for a moment the curiosity of the reader.

blishmcnt of laws and property3 and theology may perhaps be
superseded by the full light of religion and reason. But the savage

diseases are inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds
would be more frequent in the ruder ages of society. The treasures ·
of Grecian medicine had been communicated to the Arabian colo-
nies of Africa, Spain, and Sicily; ‘and in thc intercourse of peace
and war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at
Salerno, an illustrioris city, in which the men were honest and the

women beautiful ⁴⁹. A school, the first that arose in the darkness of
Europe, was consecrated to the healing art ; the conscience of monks
and bishops was reconciled to that salutary and lucrative profeffion ;
