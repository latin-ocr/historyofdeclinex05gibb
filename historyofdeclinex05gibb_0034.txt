THE DECLINE AND FALL

was diss'atisfied at receiving as a favour a scanty portion of the lni-
perial prize which he had bestowed on his equa13 and his discon-
tcnt‚ which sometimes evaporated in hasty discourse, at length as-
sumed a more threatening and hostile aspe& against a prince whom

the conspirators mingled with the proceffion, lurked in the angles of

the chapel, and expedied, as the signal of murder, the intonation of
