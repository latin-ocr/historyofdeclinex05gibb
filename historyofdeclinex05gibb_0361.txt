astonished by the strange and irrefistible terrors of the Oriental arms3
and as they poffeffed neither gold nor filver, the richest spoil was
the beauty of the female captives, some of whom were afterwards

sold for a thousand pieces of gold. The career, though not the zeal,
of Akbah was checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean. He
spurred his horse into the waves, and raising his eyes to heaven, ex-
claimed with the tone of a fanatic: “ Great God! if my course
“ were not stopped by this sea, 1 would still go on, to the unknown
‘⁶ kingdoms of the West, preaching the unity of thy holy name, and
“ putting to the sword the rebellious nations who worship any other
‘⁶ gods than thee ¹⁵³.’' Yet this Mahometan Alexander, who fighed
for new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquesta By
the universal defection of the Greeks and Africans, he was recalled
from the shores of the Atlantic, and the surrounding multitudes left
him only the resource of an honourable death. The last scene was
dignified by an example of national virtue. An ambitious chief,
who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt, was led
about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general. The insur-
gents had trusted to his discontent and revenge; he disdained their
offers and revealed their designs. In the hour of danger, the grate-
ful Akbah unlocked his fetters, and advised him to retire ; he chose
to die under the banner of hisrival. Embracing as friends and
martyrs‚ they unlheathed their scymetars‚ broke their scabbards, and
maintained an obstinate combat‚ till they fell by each others fide on
the last of their ssaughtered countrymen. The third general or go-
vernor of Africa, Zuheir‚ avenged and encountered the fate of his

¹⁵³ Otter (p. ¹19·) has given the strong wish of preaching the Koran. Yet they had

tone of fanaticism to this exclamation, which both the same text of Novairi before their
Cardonne (p-37.) has softened to a pious eyes.
