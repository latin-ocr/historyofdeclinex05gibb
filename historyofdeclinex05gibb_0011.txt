OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 7

from China to Poland and Greece: the sultans were overthrown: Cxllt‘lvffip·

the caliphs fell, and the Caesars trembled on their throne. The vic- κ-Ἶμμ
tories of Timour suspended above fifty years the final ruin of the
Byzantine empire. X. Ihave already noticed the first appearance
of the TURKS, and the names of the fathers, of Seffrck and Olhman,
discriminate the two successive dynasties of the nation‚ which emerge&
in the eleventh century from the Scythian wilderness. The former
establiffied a potent and splendid kingdom from the banks of thev
Oxus to Antioch and Nice ; and the first crusade was provoked by·
the violation of Jerusalem and the danger of Constantinople. From.
an humble origin, the Ottomam arose, the scourge and terror of Chris-
Μ. Constantinople was besleged and taken by Mahomet 110.
and his triumph annihilates the remnant, the image, the title, of
the Roman empire in the East. The schism of the Greeks will be
conneffi‘ced with their last emundes, and the restoration of learning
jn the Western world. Ι shall return from the captivit'y of the new,
to the ruins of ancient ROME: and the venerable name, the interesting
theme, will {hed a ray of glory on the conclusion of my Iabours.

THE emperor Heraclius had puniss1ed a tyrant and ascended his second mar»
throne3 and the memory of his reign is perpetuated by the transient {seat} {s He·
conquest, and ›irreparable loss, of the Eastern provinces. After the
death of Eudocia, his first wife, he disobeyed the patriarch, and
'violated the laws, by his second marriage with his niece Martina ;
and the superstition of the Greeks beheld the judgment of heaven⁴
'm the diseases of the father and the deformity of his offspring. But
the opinion of an illegitimate birth is sufficient to distra& the choice,
and loosen the obedience, of the people: the ambition of Martinav
was quickened by maternal love, and perhaps by the envy of a step-
mother 3 and the aged husband was too feeble to withstand the arts
