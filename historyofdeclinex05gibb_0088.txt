on the fallen majesty of their prince. After a thousand blows and
outrages, Andronicus was hung by the feet, between two pillars that
supported the statues of a wolf and a fow; and every hand that
could reach the public enemy, inflicted on his body' some mark of

the first great period in the fall of the Eastern empire-
