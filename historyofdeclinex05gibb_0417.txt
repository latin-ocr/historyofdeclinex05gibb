like a winged long-tailed dragon‚ about the thickness of an hogshead,

with the report of thunder and the velocity of lightning; and the
darkness of the night was dispelled by this deadly illumination.
The use of the Greek, or, as it might now be called, of the Saracen,
fire, was continued to the middle of the fourteenth century ²³, when
the seientifie or casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal,
effeeted a new revolution in the art of war aud the history of man-

The former of these editions is precious for
the observations of Ducange3 the latter, for
the pure and original text of JoinviIle. We
must have recourse to that text to discover,
that the feu Gregeois was (hot with a pile or
javeline, from an engine that acted like a ssing.

²³ The vanity‚ or envy, of {halting the
established property of Fame, has tempted
some moderns to carry gunpowder above the
xivth (see Sir William l‘emple, Dutens, &c.),
and the Greek fire above the vii‘h century
(see the Saluste du Prelident desssrofl‘es‚tom.ii.
p. 381.). But their evidence, which pre-
cedes the vulgar aera of the invention, is sel—
dom clear οι- satissaftory‚ and subsequent
writers may be suspefted of fraud or credulity.
In the earliest fieges, some combustibles of
oil and sulphur have been used, and the
Greek fire has sonu affinicies with gu-npowder
both in nature and effeets: sor the antiquity
os the first, a passage of Procopius (de Bell.
Goth. 1. iv. c. 11.); for that of the second,
some facts in the Arabic history of Spain
(A. D. ¹249- ¹3¹²· ¹33²· Bibliot. Arab.
Hisp. rom. ii. p. 6, 7, 8.)‚ arethe most diffi-
cuit to elude.

²⁴ That extraordinary man, Friar Bacon,
reveals two of the ingredients, saltpetre and
sulphur, and conceals the third in a sentence
of mysserious gibberiih, as if he dreaded the
consequentes of his own discovery (Biogra-
phia Britannica, vol. i. p. 430. new edi-
tion).

²⁵ For the invasion of France, and the de-
feat of the Arabs by Chai-les Martel‚ see the
Historia Arabum (c. 11‚12.13,14.)of Rode-
ric Ximenes‚ archbishop of Toledo, who had
before him the Christian chronicle of llidore
Pacensis, and the Mahometan history of No-
vairi. 'she Mossems are silent οι· concise

cles of France, and lives os saints, are inserted
in the conenion ofBouquet (tom iii.) and the

per years) has restored the chronology, which
is anticipated fix years in the Annals of Baro·
nius. The Diffionary of Bayle (Abderame
and Munuza) has more merit for lively re-
flection than original research.
