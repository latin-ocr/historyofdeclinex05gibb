had escaped from the field of battle. By the repetition of such acts,
the character of Mahomet must have been gradually stained5 and
the influence of such pernicious habits would be poorly compen-
sated by the practice of the personal and social virtues which are
necessary to maintain the reputation of a prophet among his seesariez
and friends. Of his last years, ambition was the ruling paffion;
and a politician will suspect, that he secretly smiled (the vic“t01·50ug
impostor ἶ) at the enthufiasm of his youth and the credulity of his
proselytes¹‘⁶. A philosopher will observe, that their credulity and
his success, would tend more strongly to fortify the affurance of his
divine miffion, that his interest and religion were inseparably con-
nected, and that his conscience would be soothed by the persuasion,
that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the obligation of po-
fitive and moral laws. If he retained any vestige of his native ina
nocence, the sms of Mahomet may be allowed as an evidence of his
fincerity. In the support of truth‚ the arts of fraud and fiction may
be deemed less criminal; and he would have started at the foulness
of the means, had he not been satisfied of the importance and jus·-
tice of the end. Even in a conqueror or a priest‚ I can surprise a
word or action of unaffected humanity ; and the decree of Mahomet‚
that, in the sale of captives, the mothers should never be separated
from their children, may suspend or moderate the censure of the
