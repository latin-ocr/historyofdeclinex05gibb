THE DECLINE AND FALL

V. ln the progress of conquest from the north and south, the Goths
and the Saracena encountered each other on the confines of Europe
and Africa. In the opinion of the latter, the difference of religion
is a reasonable ground of enmity and warfare ¹⁶⁴. As early as the
time of Othman ¹⁶⁵ their piratical squadrons had ravaged the coast of
Andalusia ¹⁶⁶ ; nor had they forgotten the relief of Carthage by the
Gothic succours. In that age, as well as in the present, the kings of
Spain were poffcffed of the fortrcss. of Ceutass one of the columns
of Hercules, which is divided by a narrow streight from the oppo-
site pillar or point of Europe. A finali portion of Mauritania was
still wanting to the African conquest3 but Musa, in the pride of
vidiory, was repulsed from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and
From his dif-
appointment and perplexity, Musa was relieved by an unes-:pedied
meffage of the Christian chief, who offered his place, his person, and
his sword, to the succeffors of Mahomet, and solicited the disgrace-

ful honour of introducing their arms into the heart of Spain ¹⁶⁷.

Greeks, Amrou observed that their religion

was different3 upon which score it was law-

¹⁴⁶ The name of Andalufia is applied by
the Arabs not only to the modern province,
but to the whole peninsula of Spain (Geo-
graph. Nub. P-131· d’Hcrbclot, Bibliot.
Orient. p. 114, ¹¹5·)· 'l'he etymology has
been most improbably deduced from Vanda-
luna, country of the Vandals (d'Anville
Etats de l’Europe‚ p. 146, 147, &c.). But
the Handalufia of Cafiri, which lignifies in
Arabia the region of the evening, of the
West, in a word, the Hesperia of the Greeks,
is perfeffly apposite (Bibliot. Arabico-His-
pana, tom. ii. p.327‚ δια).

That historian has infused into his noble
work (Historiae de Rebus Hispaniae, libri xxx.
Hagae Comitum 1733, in four volumes in
solio, with the Continuation of Miniana),
the style and spirit of a Roman claffic; and
after the xiith century, his knowledge and
judgment may be safely trusted. But the
Jesuit is not exempt stom the prejudices of
his orden he adopts and adorns, like his rival
Buchanan, the most absurd of the national
legends; he is too careless os criticism and.
chronology, and supplies, from a lively
fancy, the chasms of historica] evidence.
These chasms are large and frequent; Rode-
ric archbiffiop of Toledo, the father of the
Spanilh history, lived five hundred years aster
