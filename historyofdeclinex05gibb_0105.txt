the naked issands were abandoned to the clemency or justice of the
conqueror. The son of Leo, in the first year of his reign, had un·-
dertaken an expedition against the Saracens ι during his absence, the
capital, the palace, and the purple, were occupied by his kinsman
Artavasdes, the ambitious champion of the orthodox saith. The
worship of images was triumphantly restored z the patriarch renoun-
ced his dissimulation, or diffembled his sentirnent83 and the righteous
<claim of the usurpet was acknowledged‚ both in the new, and in
ancient, Rome. Constantine flew for refuge to his paterna] moun-
tains; but he descended at the head of the bold and affectionatc
Isaurians 3 and his final vit-{lory confounded the arms and preditffions
of the fanatics. His long reign was distraosted with clamour, sedi-
tion, conspiracy, and mutual hatred‚ and sanguinary revengei the
persecution of images was the motive, or pretence, of his adversarie33
and, ifthey miffed a temporal diadem, they were rewarded by the

Greeks with the crown of martyrdom. In every a& of open and

clandestine treason, the emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the
monks, the faithful ssaves of the superstition to which they owed
their riches and influence. They prayed, they preached, they ab-
solved, they inflamed‚ they conspired: the solitude of palestine
poured forth a torrent. of invective; and the pen of St. John Dass

of Damascus, who held a confiderable office
in the service of the caliph. His zeal in the
cause of images exposed him to the resent-

and on the suspicion of a treasonable cor-
respondence, he was deprived of his right
hand, which was miraculously restored hythe
Virgin. After this deliverance, he resigned

his office, distributed his wealrh, and buried
himself in the monastery of St. Sabas, be-
tween Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. The le-
gend is famou53 but his learned editor, fa-
ther chuicn, has unluckily proved that St.
John Damascenus was already a monk be-
fore the Iconoclast dispute (Opera, tom. i.
