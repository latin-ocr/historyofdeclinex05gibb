nation was defirous of restoring the fimplicity of the constitution; k—-v-d

and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to ascertain his own
rank and the fortune of his family. The mayor and the nobles
were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal phantom: the blood
of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes3 and their common
ambaffadors addreffed the Roman pontiff, to dispel their scruples, oi·
to absolve their promise. The interest of pope Zachary‚ the sueceffor
of the two Gregmies, prompted him to decide, and to decide in their
favour: he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite, in the
same person, the title and authority of king; and that the unfor-
tunate Childeric‚ a viffim of the public safety, should be degraded,
shaved, and confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days.
An answer, so agreeable to their wishes, was accepted by the Franks,
as the opinion of a casuist‚ the sentence of a judge, or the oracle ofa
prophet: the Merovingian raee disappeared from the earth ; and
Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people, ac-
customed to obey his laws and to march under his standard. His
coronation was twice performed, with the sanetion of the popes, by
their most faithful servant St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and
hythe grateful hands of Stephen the third, who, in the monastery
of St. Denys, placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor. The
royal unctiori of the kings of Israel was dextroussy applied ⁵⁶: the
succeffor of St. Peter affumed the character of a divine ambass'ador :
a German chieftain was transforxned into the Lord's anointed3 and

this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained by the superstition.
