honour of the throne; but they acknowledged the just punishment
of avarice and cruelty. This savage cup was deeply timitured with
the manners of the Scythian wilderness; but they were sostened
before the end of the same century by a peaceful intercourse with
the Greeks, the poffeffion of a cultivated region, and the introduc-
tion of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria were educated
in the schools and palace of Constantinople 3 and Simeon ¹⁴, a youth
of the royal line, was i11stru6'red in the rhetoric of Demosthenes and
the logic of Aristotle. He relinquissied the profcssion of a monk for
that of a king and warrior; and in his reign, of more than forty years,
Bulgaria affumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth. The
Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation from
indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and sacrilege. They
purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon, in a second
battle, redeemed the loss of the first, at a time when it was esteemed
a victory to elude the arms of that formidable nation. The Ser-·

Simeon imposed the conditions of peace. They met with the most
