THE DECLINE AND FALL

the faithful ; and the weakness or division of their tyrants sometimes
restored the Abbaffides to the sovereignty of Bagdad. But their
misfortunes had been embittered by the triumph of‘the Fatimites‚
the real or spurious progeny of Ali. Arifing from the extremity
of Africa, these successful rivals extinguished‚ in Egypt and Syria,
