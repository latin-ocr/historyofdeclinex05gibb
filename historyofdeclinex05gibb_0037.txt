judge, sufficient or ample damages to the plaintifl', the sovereign ad- ffi-s—-a

judged to her use and benefit the palaee and the ground. Nor was
Theophilus content with this extravagant satisfaction: his zeal -con—
verted a civil trespass into a criminal a& ; and the unfortunate patri—
cian was stripped and scourged in the public place of Constanti-
nople. For some venial offences, some defecit of eqnity or vigilance,
the principal ministers, a praefed't, a quaestor, a captain of the
guards, were banished or mutilated, or scalded with boiling pitch,
or burnt alive in the hippodrome; and as these dreadful examples
might be the effeets of error or caprice, they must have alienated

from his service the best and wisest of the citizens. But the pride ,

of the monarch was flattered in the exercisef of power, or, as he
thought, of virtue3 and the people, safe in their obscurity, ap-
plauded the danger and debasement of their superiors. This ex·-
traordinary rigour was justified, in some measure, by its salutary
consequences; smee, after a scrutiny of seventeen days, not a com-
plaint or abuse could be found in the court or city: and it might be
alleged that the Greeks could be ruled only with a rod of iron, and
that the public interest is the motive and law of the supreme judge.
Yet in the crime, or the suspicion, of treason, that judge is of all
others the most credulous and partial. Theophilus might inflict a
tardy vengeance on the affaffins of Leo and the saviours of his fa-
ther; but he enjoyed the fruits of their crime; and his jealous
tyranny sacrificed a brother and a prince to the future safety of his
life. A Perfian of the race of the Saffanides died in poverty and
exile at Constantinople, leaving an only son, the iffue of a plebeian
marriage. At the age of twelve years, the royal birth of Theopho-
bus was revealed, and his merit was not unworthy of his birth.
He was educated in the Byzantine palace, a Christian and a soldier3

advanced with rapid steps in the career of fortune and glory3 re·
