they bestowed the Roman benefice, like the bishoprics of Cologne
or Bamberg, on their chancellors or preceptors ; and whatever might
be the merit of a Frank or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the
interposition of foreign power. These aets of prerogative were most

who had been excluded by the cardinals, appealed to the pallions or
avariee of the multitude: the Vatican an the Lateran were stained
with blood ; and the most powerful senators, the marquiffes of Tus-
cany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in a long
and disgraceful servitude. The Roman pontiffs, of the ninth and
tenth centra-ies, were insulted, imprisoned, and murdered, by their
tyrants ; and such was their indigence after the loss and usurpation
