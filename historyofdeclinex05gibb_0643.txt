OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

titlent is neither inacceffible nol invincible: yet the great princes
and powers of Christendom have repeatedly failed in their arma-
ments against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest

and long servitude of Spain.
Since the decease of Robert Guiscaiqd the Normans had relin-

Byzantine court was expiated‚ according to .« the laws of nadons,

of their inheritance or industry. On the approach of the Normans
the lower town of Corinth was evacuated: the Greeks retired to the
