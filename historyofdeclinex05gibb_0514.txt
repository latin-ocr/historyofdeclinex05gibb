THE DECLINE AND FALL

soar above the means of cseaping a defeat, and procrastinating the
war ⁸². Notwithstanding some transient success, the Greeks were
sunk in their own esteem and that of their neighbours. A cold
hand and a loquacious tongue was the vulgar description of the na-
tion: the author of the streties was besieged in his capital 3 and the
last of the Barbarians, who trembled at the name of the Saracens,
or Franks, could proudly exhibit the medals of gold and sllver which
they had extorted from the feeble sovereign of Constantinople.
What spirit their government and charaeter denied, might have been
inspired in some degree by the influence of religion3 but the religion
of the Greeks could only teach them to suffer and to yield. The
emperor Nicephorus, who restored for a moment the discipline and
glory of the Roman name, was defirous of bestowing the honours
of martyrdom on the Christiane. who lost their lives in an holy war
against the infidels. But this political law was defeated by the op-
pofition of the patriarch, the bishops, and the principa] semitm-53
and they strenuoussy urged the canons of St. Baffl, that all who
were polluted by the bloody trade of a soldier, should be separated,
during three years, from the communion of the faithful ⁸³.

These scruples of the Greeks have been compared with the tears
of the primitive Mossems when they were held back from battle3
