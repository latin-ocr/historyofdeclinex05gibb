prize was disputed by the genereus emulation of the bards; the*
victorious performance was deposited in the archives of princes and
emirs; and we may read in our own language, the seven original>
poems which were inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the¹
temple of Mecca ⁴¹. The Arabian poets were the historians and:
moralists of the age3 and if they sympathised with the prejudice8‚.
they inspired and crowned the virtues, of their countrymen. The
indiffoluble union of generosity and valour was the darling theme
of their song3 and when they pointed their keenest satire against a
d‘espicable racc, they affirmed, in the bitterness of reproach, that the-
men knew not how to give, nor the women to deny⁴². The same·
hospitality, which was pra&ised by Abraham and celebrated by·
Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs. The ferocious
Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace‚ without enquiry or⁴
hesitation, the stranger who dares to conside in their honour and to
enter their tent. His treatment is kind and respeetful: he {hares the
wealth or the poverty of his host3 aud, after a needful repose, he is*
dismissed on his way, with thanks, with bleflings, and perhaps with
gifts. The heart and hand are more largely expanded by the wants
of a brother or a friend; but the heroic adts that could deserve the· ”
public applaust, must have surpasscd the narrow measure of discre-
tion and experience. A disputc had misen, who, among the citizens
of mecca, was entitlcd to the prize of generosity; and a successive
application was made to the three who were deemed most worthy of
the trial. Abdallah‚the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant jour-
