adjacent plain. Mahadia was besieged by George the Sicilian ad-
miral‚ with a fleet of one hundred and fifty gallies, amply provided
with men and the instrumente of mischief: the sovereign had fied,
the Moorish governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and
irresistible affaust, and secretly escaping with the Mossem inhabitants,
abandoned the place and its treasures to the rapacious Franks. In
succeffive expeditioris, the king of Sicily or his lieutenants reduced
the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capfia, Bona, and a long tra& of the
sea-coast¹⁰⁶; the fort1·effes were garrisoned‚ the country was tribu-
