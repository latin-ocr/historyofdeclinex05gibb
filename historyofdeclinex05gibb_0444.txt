camprnent on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis οι· Scutari, in-
formed Irene, in her palace of Constantinople‚ of the loss of her
troops and provinces. With the consent or connivance of their so-
vereign her ministers subscribed an ignoininious peace3 and the ex-
change of some royal gifts could not disguise the annual tribute of

seventy thousand dinars of gold, which was imposetl on the Roman

 

empire. The Saracens had too rashly advanced into the midst of a
distant and hostile land: their retreat was solicited by the promise of
faithful guides and plentiful market83 and not a Greek had courage ¹
to whisper, that their weary forces might be surrounded and de·-
stroyed in their neceffary passage between a ssippery mountain and
the river Sangarius. Five years after this expedition, Harun ascended ᾇ
the throne of his father and his elder brother3 the most powerful

and vigorous monarch of his race, illustrious in the west, as the ally

of Charlemagne, and familiar to the most childish readers, as the
perpetual hero of the Arabian tales. His title to the name of Al

Reffhid (the ngst) is sullied by the extirpation of the generous, per-

haps the innocent, Barmecides ; yet he could listen to the complaint

of a poor widow who had been pillaged by his troops, and who

dared, in a passage of the Koran, to threaten the inattentive despot

with the judgment of God and posterity. His court was adorned

with luxury and science3 but, in a reign of three-and·twenty

years, Harun repeatedly vifited his provinces from chorasan to

Egypt; nine times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca3 eight

times he invaded the territories of the Romans5 and as often as
