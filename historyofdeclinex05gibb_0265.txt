oF THE ROMAN EMPIRE 261.

Abubeker and Omar, the prudence of the first, the sev e1ity of the C HL A P.
second, maintained the peace and prosperity of their reigns. The c-„—e
feeble temper and declining age os Othman were incapable of sus-
taining the weight of conquest and empire. He chose, and he was
deceived3 he trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of

the faithful became useless or hostile to his government‚ and his
lavish bounty was productive only of ingratitude and discontent.

The spirit of discord went· forth in the provinces, their deputies
assembled at Medma, and the Charegites, the desperate fanatics who
diselaimed the yoke of subordination and reason, were confounded
among the free—born Arabs, who demanded the redress of their wrongs

and the punishment of their oppreffors. From Cufa, from Baffom,
from Egypt, from the tribes of the desert, they rose in πῶς, en-
camped about a league from Mediam, and dispatched an haughty
mandate to their sovereign‚ requiring him to execute justice, or to
descend from the throne. His repentance began to disarm and dis-
perse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled by the arts of his
enemies 3 and the forgery of a perfidious secretary was contrived to

blast his reputation and p1·ecip‘1tate his fall. The caliph had lost the

only guard of his predeceffors, the esteem and confidence of the
Mossems3 during a fiege of fix weeks his water and p1·ovis10ns
were intercepted, and the feeble gates of the palace were protected

only by the scruples of the more timorous rebels. Forsaken by those

who had abused his fimplicity, the helpless and venerable caliph ex-
pected the appaxo ch ot death: the brother of As'ye na mar hed t

the head of the affxffins3 and Othman‚ with the Kom n in nis lap, D aihu(
was pierced u 1th a mult {tude of' wounds. A tunultuous ana rel y (ἔξω D ’
of five days was appeased by the inauguriat on of Ali· ‚ih ε re ’.1 1³¹³
would have provokcd a general maffacre. ln this pa-inful fitndtien
