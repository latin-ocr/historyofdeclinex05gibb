THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H Α Ρ· The Nadhirites were more guilty, since they conspired in a friendly
s--ssga interview to affaffinate the prophet. He bcfieged their castle three

miles frorn Medina, but their resolute defence obtained an honour-
able capitulation3 and the garrison, founding their trumpets and*
beating their drums, was permitted to depait with the honours of
war. The Jews had excited and joined the war of the Koreish: no
sooner had the nations retired from the ditch, than Mahomet, with-

an inflexible eye the ssaughter of his helpless enemies. Their sheep
and camels were inherited by the Musulmans: three hundred
cuiraffes, five hundred pikes, a thousand lances, composed the most
useful portion of the spoil. Six days journey to the north-east of
Medina‚ the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat οἷ’
the Jewish power in Arabia3 the territory, a fertile spot in the desert,¹
was covered with plantations and cattle, and protected by eight
castles, some of which were esteemed of impregnable strength.
The forces of Mahornet confisted of two hundred horse and fourteen
hundred foot: in the succeffion of eight regular and painful fieges
they were exposed to danger, and fadgue, and 'hunger3 and the·
most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event. The apostle revived.
their faith and courage by the example of Ali, on whom he bestowed
the surname of the Lion of God ; perhaps we may believe that an
Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven to the chest by
