which he held near slve and twenty years. His three sons, Christo-
pher, Stephen‚ and Constantine, were successively adorned with the
same honours, and the lawful emperor was degraded from the first
to the fifth rank in this college of princes. Yet, in the preservation
of his life and crown, he might still applaud his own fortune and
the clemency of the usurpet. The examples of ancient and modern
history would have excused the ambition of Romanus: the powers
and the laws of the empire were in his hand; the spurious birth of
Constantine would have justified his exelufi0n; and the grave or
the monastery was open to receive the son of the concubine. But
Lecapenus does not appear to have poffeffed either the virtues or the
vices of a tyrant. The spirit and activity of his private life dis-1

pleasures, he forgot the safety both of the republie and of his family.
Of a mild and religious character, he respected the sanctity of oaths‚
the innocence of the youth, the memory of his parents and the at-
tachment of the people. The studious temper and retirement of
Constantine, disarmed the jealousy of power: his books and mufic,
his pen and his pencil‚ were a constant source of amuse1nent3 and
if he could improve a scanty allowance by the sale of his pietures,
if their price was not enhanced by the name of the artist‚ he was
endowcd with a personal talem, which few princes could employ in

the hour of adverfity.

The fall of Romanus was occasioned by his own vices and those
of his children. After the decease of Christopher‚ his eldest son, the
two surviving brothers quarrelled with each other, and conspired
against their father. At the hour of noon, when all strangers were
regularly excluded from the palme, they entered his apartment with

an armed force, and conveyed him, in the habit of a monk, to a
