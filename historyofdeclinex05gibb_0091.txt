OF &HE ROMAN EMPIRE. 37

But the peculiar infelicity of the Byzantine princes exposed thern CX1{Vzle p,
to domestic perils, without affording any lively promise of foreign .
conquest. From the pinnacle of greatness‚ Andronicus was preci..

pitated by a death more eruel and shameful than that of the vilest
malefastor3 but the most glorious of his predeceffors had much

more to dread from their subjeets than to hope from their enemies.

The army was licentious without spirit, the nation turbulent with-
out freedom: the Barbarians of the East and W est preffed on the

monarehy‚ and the loss of the provinces was terminated by the final
servitude of the capital.

The entire series of Roman emperors, from the first of the Caesars
to the last of the Constantium, extends above fifteen hundred years :
and the term of dominion, unbroken by foreign conquest, surpasse&
the measure of the ancient monarchies ; the Assyrians or Medes, the
succeffors of Cyrus, or those of Alexander.
