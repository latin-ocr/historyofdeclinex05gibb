of Eudocia made some proficiency in philosophy and rhetoric3 but
his charaster was degraded, rather than cnnobled, by the virtues of
a monk and the learning of a sophist. Strong in the contempt of

ι ,their sovereign and their own esteem, two generals, at the head of

the European and Afiatic legions, affumed the purple at Adrianople
and Nice. Their revolt was in the same month3 they bore the
same name of Nicephorus; but the two candidates were distinguished
by the surnames of Bryennius and Botaniates; the former in the
maturity of wisdom and courage, the latter conspicuous only by the
memory of his past exploits. While Botaniates advanced with cau-
tious and dilatory steps, his affitive competitor stood in arms before
the gates of Constantinople. The name of Bryennius was illustrious;
his cause was popular; but his licentious troops could not be re-
strained from burning and pillaging a suburb3 and the people‚ who
would have hailed the rebel, rejected and repulsed the incendiary of
his country. This change of the public opinion was favourable to
Botaniates, who at length, with an army of Turks, approached the
shores of Chalcedon. A formal invitation, in the name of the
patriarch, the synod, and the senate, was circulated through the

streets of Constantinople; and the general affembly, in the dome of
St. Sophia, debated, with order and calmness, on the choice of their

sovereign. The guards of Michael would have dispcrsed this un-
armed multitude; but the feeble emperor, applauding his own mo·
deration and clemency, resigned the ensigns of royalty, and was
rewarded with the monastic habit, and the title of archbilhop of
Ephesus. He left a son, a Constantine, born and educated in the

purple3 and a daughter of the house of Ducas illustrated the blood,
and confirmed the succeffion, of the Coninenian dynasty.
