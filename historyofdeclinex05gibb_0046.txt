affeffors. A sufficient list of honest and able agents was instantly —
produced by the minister3 but on the more careful scrutiny of Bafil
himself, only two could be found, who might be safely entrusted
with such dangerous powers; and they justified his esteem by de-
clining his confidence. But the serious and successful diligence of
the emperor established by degrees an equitable balance of property
and payment, of receipt and expenditure : a peculiar fund was ap-

of the prince and the property of the people. After reforming the

ever costly, may deserve some praise and much excuse : from thence
industry is fed, art is encouraged, and some object is attained of
public emolument or pleasure : the use of a road, an aquedud, or an
hospital, is obvious and solid3 and the hundred churches that arole

unsafe to pardon, were condemned, after the loss of their eyes, to a
life of solitude and repentance. The change of language and man-

the voluminous body of his Institutes, pandens, Code, and Novels,
was digestcd under forty titles, in the Greek idiom3 and the Bzfilics,
which were improved and completed by his son and grandson, must
be referred to the original genius of the founder of their race. This
glorious reign was terminated by an accident in the chace. A fu-
