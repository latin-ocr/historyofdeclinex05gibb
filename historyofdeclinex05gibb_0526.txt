benefit of the philosophical common-place book of Stobaeus‚ the
*grammatical and historic lexicon of Suidas, the Chiliads of Tzetzes,
which comprise six hundred narratives in twelve thousand verses,
and the commentaries on Homer of Eustathius archbissiop of Thes-
salonica, who, from his horn of plenty, has poured the names and
authorities of four hundred writers. From these originals, and froin
the numerous tribe of scholiasts and critics ¹⁰⁹, some estimate may be
formed of the literary wealth of the twelfth century: Constantino-
ple was esnlightened by the genius of Homer and Demosthenes, of
Aristotle and Plat03 and in the enjoyment or neglect of our present
riches, we must envy the generation that could still peruse the his-
tory of Theopompus, the orations of Hyperides, the comedies of
Menander¹¹⁰‚ and the odes of Aleaeus and Sappho. The frequent
labour of illustration attests not only the existence but the popularity
