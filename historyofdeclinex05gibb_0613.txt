levied among the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and country- C 113? Ρ-

men had divided the fertile lands of Apulia3 but they guarded their ⁸--v-——¹
{hares with the jealousy of avarice: the aspiring youth was driven

forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his first exploits against

the Greeks and the natives, it is not easy to discriminate the hero

from the robber. To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnarc a

wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food,

were the obscure labours which formed and exercised the powers of

his mind and body, The volunteers of Normandy adhered to his

fland-ard 3 and, under his command, the peasants of Calabria affumed

the name and character of Normans.

As the genius of Robert expanded 'with his fortune, he awakened ξῖιῑέ ῗὲῐέξὲῑὲΜ

their guardian and uncle-33 and Guiscard was exalted 011 a buckler,
and saluted count of Apulia and general of the republic. With an
encrease of authority and of force, he resumed the conquest of Calabria,
and soon aspired to* a rank that should raise him for ever above the
heads of his equale. By some aas of rapine or sacrilege, he had
incurred a papal excommunication: but Nicholas the second was
easily persuaded, that the divifions of friends could terminate only in
their mutual prejudice3 that the Normans vvere the faithful cham-
pions of the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a
prince than the caprice of an aristocracy. A synod of one hundred
bilhops was convened at Melphi 3 and the count interrupted an im-
portant enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of
the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy conferi-ed on Robert
