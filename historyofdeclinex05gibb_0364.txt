THE DECLINE AND FALL

a powerful reinforcement of Goths¹⁵⁸ was obtained from the feare
and religion of the Spanish monarch. The weight of the confede-
rate navy broke the chain that guarded the entrance of the harbour3
the Arabs retired to Cairoan, or Tripoli; the Christians landed ; the
citizens hailed the enfign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted
in the dream of viciory or deliverance. But Africa was irrecover-
ably lost: the zeal and resentrnent of the commander of the faith-

ful ¹⁵⁹ prepared in the ensuing spring a more numerous armament by
sea and land3 and the patrician in his turn was compelled to eva-

A second battle was
fought in the neighbourhood of Utica: the Greeks and Goth's*'were

again defeated3 and their timely embarkation saved them from the
sword of Haffan, who had invested the ssight and insufficient ram-
part of their camp. XVhatever yet remained of Carthage, was deli-
vered to the flames, and the colony of Dido¹⁶⁰ and Caesar lay de-

niccly ascertained the chronology by a stri&
comparison of the Arabic and Byzantine
historians, who osten disagree both in time

Goni; and afterwards, i Romani fuggirono ei
Gotti, laseiarono Carthagine (Leo African.
fol. 72. redo). 1 know not from what Arabic
writer the African derived his Goths‚ but the

improper definition of the caliph. Theo-
phanes introduces the strange appellation of

or secretary, and that the office of vizir was
not revivcd or instituted till the 132⁴ year of
the Hegira (d’Herbelot, p. 912.).
