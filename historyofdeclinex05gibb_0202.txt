domestic happiness, his life was prolonged to the age of one hun-
dred and ten yeam, and he became the father of six daughters and
thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah was the most beautiful and
modest of the Arabian youth; and in the first night, when he con-
summated his marriage with Amina, of the noble race of the Zahrites,
two hundred virgins are said to have expired of jealousy and despair.
Nlahomet‚ or more properly Mohammed‚ the only son of Abdallah
and Amina, was born at Mecea, four years after the death of Justi-
nian„and two months after the defeat of the Abyffinians⁶⁶‚ whose
viclory would have introduced into the Caaba the religion of the Chris-
tians. In his early infancy, he was deprived of his father, his mo.
