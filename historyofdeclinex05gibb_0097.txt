stranger, who had invoked his healing power, and offered the strong k--w-—ae

city of Edessa to prote& him against the malice of the Jews. The
ignorance of the primitive church is explained by the long impri-
sonment of the image in a nich of the wall, from whence, after an
oblivion of five hundred years, it was released by some prudent
bishop‚ and seasonably presented to the devotion of the times. Its
first and most glorious exploit was th? deliverance of the city from
the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan3 and it was soon revered as a
pledge of the divine promise, that Edeffa should never be taken by
a foreign enemy. lt is true indeed, that the text of Procopius
ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valour of
her citizens, who purchased the absence and repelled the affaults of
the Persian monarch. He was ignorant, the profane historiam, of
the testimony which he is conipelled to deliver in the ecclefiastical page
of Evagrius, that the Palladium was exposed on the rampart, and
that the water Which had been sprinkled on the holy face, in-
stead of quenching, added neur fewel to the flames of the besieged.
After this important service, the image of Edeffa was preserved with
respee‘c and gratitude3 and if the Armenians rejected the legend,
the more credulous Greeks adored the similitude, whichwas not
the work of any mortal pencil, but the immediate creation of the
divine original. The style and sentiments ofa Byzantine hymn
will declare how far their worship was removed from the groffest
idolatry. “ How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image,
“ whose celestial splendour the host of heaven presumes not to be-
“ hold? HE who divells in heaven condescends this day to visit us
