The luxury of the caliphs‚ so useless to their private happiness, re·
laxed the nerves, and terminated the progr-ess, of the Arabiam empIre.
Temporal and spiritual conquest had been the sole occupation cf the
first successors of Nlahomet3 and after supplying themselves with
the neceffaries of life, the whole revenue was serupuloussy devoted to
that salutary work. The Abbaffides were impoverished by the mul-
titude of their wants and their contempt of oeconomy. Instead of
pursuing the great obje& of ambitiosi, their leisure, theIr affeffifions,
the powers of their mind, were diverted by pomp and pleasure: the
rewards of valour were embezzled by women and eunuchs, and the
royal camp was encumbered by the luxury of the palace. A fimilar
temper was diffused among the subje&s of the caliph. Their stem
entl1ufias1n was sostened by time and prosperity: they fought riches
in the occupatione, os industry, farne in the pursuits of literature,
and happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life. War was no
longer the paffion of the Saracens ; and the encrease of pay, the re..
petition of donatives‚ were insufficient to allure the posterity of those
voluntary champions who had crowded to the standard of Abubeker
and Omar for the hopes of spoil and of paradise.
