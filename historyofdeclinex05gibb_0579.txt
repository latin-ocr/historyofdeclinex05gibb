OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

the fleets of the Cosacks‚ which issued from the Borysthenes, to na·
vigate the same seaS‚ for a similar purpose ⁵³. The Greek appella-
tion of monoxyla, or single canoes, might be justly applied to the bot-
tom of their vessels. It was scooped out ofthe long stem of a beech
oi· willow, but the ssight and narrow foundation was raised and con-
tinued on either fide vvith planks, till it attained the length of sixty‚
and the height of about twelve‚ feet. These boats were built with-
out a deck, but with two rndders and a mast3 to move with sails
and oars3 and to contain from forty to seventy men, with their·
arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fifh. The first trial of
the Ruffians was made with two hundred boats; but when the na-
tional force was e-xerted‚ they might arm against Constantinople a
thousand or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet was not much in-
ferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was magnified' in the
eyes of sear to ten or fifteen times the real proportion of its strength
and numbers. Had the Greek emperors been endowed with fore-
slght to discern, and vigour to prevent, perhaps they might have
sealed with a maritime force the mouth of the Borysthenes. Their
indolence abandoned the coast of Anatolia to the calamities of a
piratical war, which, after an interval of six hundred years, again
infested the Euxine3 but as long as the capital was respedstd, the
sufferings ofa distant province escaped the notice both of the prince
and the historiam. The storm which had swept along from the
Phasis and Trebizond, at length burst on the Bosphorus of Thrace;
a streight of fifteen miles, in which the rude vessels of the Ruffian
might have been stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary.
