THE DECLINE AND FALL

distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war, nor summer nor ,

winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy cannot easily reconcile
the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditioris. But this
stitivit-y wasa national rather than a personal virtue ; the vagrant life of
a Frank was spent in the chace, in pilgrimage, in military adventures·,
and the journies of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more:
numerous train and a more important purpose. His military re-
nown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his enemies‚ and:
his aistions. Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip, but the·
two heroes who preceded Charlemagne, bequeathed him their name,
their examples, and the companions of their victories. At the head:
of his veteran and superior armies, he oppressed the savage or de-
generate nations‚ who were incapable of confederating for their:
common safety ε ’nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist ist·
numbers, in discipline, or in arms. The science of war has been lost:
and revived. with the arts of peace ; but his campaigns are not illus--
trated by any siege or battle, of singular difficulty and success; and'

father. After his Spanilh expedition, his reah-guard was defeated*
in the Pyrenaean mountains3 and the soldiers, whose situation was
irretrievable and whose valour was useless, might· accuse, with their
