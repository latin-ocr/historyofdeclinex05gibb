OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

and populous kingdom, as they are proved by expericnce, would excuse „qs-„d

the computation of imaginary millions. The territories of Athens,
Sparta, and their alhes, do not exceed a moderate province of France
or England: but after the trophies of Salamis and Plataea, they ex-
pand in our fancy to the gigantic fize of Asia, which had been tram-
pled under the feet of the victorious Greeks. But the subjects of
the Byzantine empire, who assume and dishonour the names both
of *Greeks and Romans, present a dead uniformity of abjeci vices,
which are neither sostened by the weakness of humanity, nor ani-
mated by the vigour of memorable crimes. The freemen of anti-
quity might repeat with generous enthufiasni the sentence of Homer,
“ that on the first day of his servitude, the captive is deprived of
“ one half of his manly virtue.’' But the poet had only seen the
effefis of civil or domestic ssavery, nor could he foretell that the
second moiety of manliood must be annihilated by the spiritual de-
spotism, which ffiaekles, not only the actions, but even the thoughts
of the prostrate votary. By this double yoke, the Greeks were op-
preffed under the succefl‘ors of Heraclius; the tyrant, a law of eter-
nal justice, was degraded by the vices of his subjec’ts ς and on the
throne, in the camp, in the schools, we search, perhaps with fruitless
diligence, the names and characters that may deserve to be rescued
from oblivion. Nor are the defects of the subject compensate-:d by
the {kin and variety of the painters. Of a space of eight hundred
years, the four first centuries are overspread with a cloud interrupted
by some faint and broken rays¹ of historic light: in the lives of the
emperors, from Maurice to Alexius, Bafil the Macedonian has alone
‘been the theme of a separate work ; and the absence, or loss, or im-
perfestion of contemporary evidence, must be poorly supplied by the
doubtful authority of more recent compilers. The four last cen-
‘m'ries are exempt from the reproach of penury: and with the Com-
