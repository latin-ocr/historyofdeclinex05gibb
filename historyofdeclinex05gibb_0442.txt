Want of eru-
dition‚ taste,
and fzeedom.

THE DEC'LINE AND FALL

But the Mossems deprived themselves of the principal benefits of
a familiar intercourse with Greece and Rome, the knowledge of
antiquity‚ the purity of taste‚ and the freedom of thought. Confi-
dent in the riches of their native tongue, the Arabians disdained the
study of any foreign idiom. The Greek interpreters were chosen
among their Christian subjecte ; they formed their transsations, some-
times on the original text, more frequently perhaps on a Syriae
version: and in the crowd of astronomers and phyficiam, there is
no example of a poet, an orator, or even an histor-ian, being taught
to speak the language of the Saracens ⁷⁰. The mythology of Homer
would have provoked the abhorrence of those stem fanatics: they
poffeffed in lazy ignorance the colonies of the Macedonians, and the
provinces of Carthage and Rome: the heroes of Plutarch and Livy
were buried in oblivion3 and the history of the world before Ma·-
homet was reduced to a {hort legend of the patriarchs, the pro-
phets, and the Perfian kings. Our education in the Greek and
Latin schools may have fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive
taste; and Ι am not forward to condemn the literature and judgment
of naumis, of whose language Ι am ignorant. Yet I know that the
classics have much to teach, and Ι believe that the Orientals have
much to learn: the temperate dignity of style, the graceful propor-
tions of art, the forms of vifible and intellectual beauty, the just
delineation of character and paffion, the rhetoric of narrative and
argument, the regular fabric of epie and dramatic poetry⁷¹. The

⁷0 Abulpharagius (Dynast. p- 25. 148.) ⁷¹ Ι have perused, with much pleasure,
mentions a Syriae verslon of Homer’s two Sir William Jones’s Latin Commentary on
poems, by Theophilus, a Christian Maronite Afiaxic poeti-y (London, 1774, in ostavo),
of mount Libanus, who profcffcd assronomy which was composed in the youth of that
