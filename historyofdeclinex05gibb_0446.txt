Taurus ε his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted ; and the
perfidious Greek escaped with three wound's from a field of battle
overspread with forty thousand of his subjeets. Yet the emperor
was ashamed of submiffion, and the caliph was resolved on victory.
One hundred· and thirty-five thousand regular soldiers received pay,
and were inscribed in thev military 1:0113 and above three hundred.
thousand persons of every denomination marched under the black
standard of the Abbaffides. They swept the surface of Afra Minor
far beyond Tyana and Ancyra, and invested the Pontic Hera-
elea ⁷⁷, once a flourishing state, now a paltry town; at that time
capable of sustaining in her antique walls a month⁷s fiege against the
forces of the East. The· ruin wasv complete, the spoil was ample3
but if Harun had been conversant with Grecian story, he would have
regretted the statue of Hercules, whose attributes, the club, the bow,
the quiver, and the lion's hide, were sculptured in· maffy gold. The
progress of desolation by sea and land, from the Euxine to the isse*
of Cyprus, compelled the. emperor Nicephorus to retra& his haughty
defiance. In the new treaty, the ruins of Heraclea were left for
ever as a leffon and a trophy3 and the coin of the tribute was
marked with the image and superfcription of Harun and his three
sons ⁷⁸. Yet this plurality of lordsvmight contribute to remove the dis-

honour of the Roman name, After the death of their father, the

⁷⁷ MdeTournesort, in his coasting voyage
from Constantinople to Trebizond, passed a
night at Heraclea or Eregri. His eye sur-
veyed the present flare, his reading conceied
the antiquities‚ of the city (Voyage du Le·

vant, tom. iii. lettre xvi. p. 23—35.). We>

have a separate history ofHeraclea in the frag-

{namt-s of Memnon, which are preserved by
onus.
