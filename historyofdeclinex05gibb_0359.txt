an army of thirty thousand Greeks, swept away fourscore thousand
captives, and enriched with their spoils the bold adventurers of

Syria and Egypt ¹⁴⁶. But the title of conqueror of Africa is more
justly due to his successor Akbah. He marched from Damascus at
the head of ten thousand of the bravest Arab33 and the genuine
force of the Mossems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conver-
fion of many thousand Barbarians. It would be difficult, nor is it
necessary, to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah. The
interior regions have been peopled by the Orientals with fictitious
armies and imaginary citadels. In the warlike province of Zab or
Numidia, fourscore thousand of the natives might affemble in arms;
but the number of three hundred and fixty towns is incompatible
with the ignorance or decay of husbandry¹⁴⁷3 and a circumferenee

the adjacent mountains might have supplied a braver people with the
instruments of defence. The remote pofition and venerable anti-
