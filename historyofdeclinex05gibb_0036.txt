October 3.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

fellow-soldier, he inceffantly presscd the discovery of more accom-
plices, till his curiosity was checked by the question of an honest or

guilty minister: “ would you give credit to an enemy, against the
““ most faithful of your friends ?” After the death of his lirst wife,

the emperor, at the request of the-senate, drew from her monastery
Euphrosyne, the daughter of Constantine the sixth. Her august
birth might justify a stipulation iu the marriage-contradi, that her
children should equally share the cmpire with their elder brother.
But the nuptials of Michael and Euphrosyne were barren3 and she
was content with the title of mother of Theophilus, his son and

successor.

The charaeter of Theophilus ‘is a rare example in which reli-
gious zeal has allowed, and perhaps magnified, the virtues of an he-
retic and a persecutor. His valour was often felt by the enemies,
and his justice by the subjects, of the monarchy ; but the valour of
Theophilus was rash and fruitless, and his justice arbitrary and
cruel. He displayed the banner of the cross against the Saracens3

but his five expeditioris were concluded by a fignal overthrow3

Amorium, the ‘native city of his ancestors‚ was levelled with the -

ground, and from his military toils, he derived only the surname of

the Unfortunate. The wisdom of a sovereign is comprised in the
institution of laws and the choice of magistrateS, and while he seems

>without aetion, his civil government revolves round his centre with
,the silence and order of the planetary system. But the justice of

Theophilus was fassiioned on the model of the Oriental despots,
who, in personat and irregular acis of authority, consult the reason
or paffion of the moment, without measuring the sentence by the
law or the penalty by the offence. A poor woman threw herself at
the emperor's feet to complain of a povserfiil neighbour, the brother
of the empress, who had raised his palace wall to such an inconvenient

height, that her humble dwelling was excluded from light and air!
