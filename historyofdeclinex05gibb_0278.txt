THE DECLINE AND FALL

3'· the property of mankind, are guarded by the infallible and immu—

table sand'tion of the will of God. This religious servitude is at-
tended with some praelical disadvantage 3 the illiterate legissator had
been often missed,by his own prejudices and those of his country;
and the institutions of the Arabiam desert may be ill-adapted to the
