40 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H Α Ρ· her place. The public administration had been abandoned to the

Q Caesar Bardas, the brother and enemy of Theodora 3 but the arts of
female influence persuaded Michael to hate and to fcar his uncle:
he was drawn from Constantinople, under the pretence of a Cretan
expedition, and stabbed in the tent of audience‚ by the sword of the
chamberlain, and in the presence of the emperor. About a month
after this execution, Bafil was invested with the title of Augustus
and the government of the empire. He supported this unequal as-
sociation till his influence was fortified by popular esteem. His life
was endangered by the caprice of the emperor ς and bis dignity was
profaned by a second colleague, who had rowed in the gallies. Yet
the murder of his benefaQ0r must bc condemned as an a& of in-
gratitude and treason3 and the churehes which he dedicated to the
name of St. Michael‚ were a poor and puerile expiation of his
guilt.

The different ages of Bafil the first, may be compared with those
of Augustus. The situation of the Greek did not allow him inq-his
earliest youth to lead an army against his country, or to proscribe
the noblest of her sons3 but his aspiring genius stooped to the arts
of a ssave3 he diffembled his ambition and even his virtues, and
grasped, with the bloody hand of an affaffin, the empire which he
ruled with the wisdom and tenderness of a parent. A private citizen
may feel his interest repugnant to his duty3 but it must be from a
deficiency of sense or courage, that an absolute monarch can separate
‚his happiness from his glory, or his glory from the public welfare.
The life or panegyric of Bafil has indeed been composed and pub-
lished under the long reign of his descendant83 but even their sta-
bility on the throne may be justly ascribed to the superior merit of
their ancestor. ln his charaeter, his grandson Constantine has at-
tempted to delineate a perse& image of royalty: but that feeble

prince, unless he had copied a real model, could not easily have
