THE DECLINE AND FALL

μ-Ὓ--ι was often violated: in each invafion‚ after the vietory or retreat

of their countrymen‚ some wandering tribe, embracing the⁴ Maho-
metan saith, obtained a free encampment in the spacious plains ancl>
pleasant climate of Transoxiana and Carizme. The Turkifh ssaves
who saspired to the throne encouraged these emigrations, which re-
cruited their armies, awed their subjeecs and rivals‚ and prote6³oed the
frontier against the wilder natives of Turkestan3 and this policy was
abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide beyond the example of former
times. He was admonilhed of his error by a chief of the race of
Seljuk, who dwelt in the territory of Bochara. The sultan had en-
quired what supply of men he could furnilh for military service.
“ If you send,” replied Ismael, ‘⁶ one of these arrows into our
“ camp, fifty thousand of your servants will mount on horsebaekl’
“ And if that nurnber‚” continued Mahmud‚ ‘⁵ should not be suf-
“ ficient?” “ Send this second arrow to the hord of Balik, and
“ you will find fifty thousand more.” “ But,'’ said the Gaznevide,
diffembling his anxiety‚ “ ifI should stand in need of the whole

¹‘ force of your kindred tribes ?'’ “ Dispatch my bow‚” was the last

reply of Ismael, “ and as it is circulated amand, the summons will
“ be obeyed by two hundred thousand horse.” The apprehension
of such formidable friendship induced Mahmudv to transport the most
obnoxious tribes into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be
separated from their brethren by the river Oxus, and inclosed on alI
fides by the walls of obedient cities. But the face of the country
was an object of temptation rather than te1·ror; and the vigour of
government was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan
of Gazna. The ssrepherds were converted into robbers 3 the bands
of robbers were colleGoed into an army of conquerors: as far as
Ispahan and the Tigris, Perfia was afflitsted by their predatory in-
roads; and the Turkmans were not afhamed or afraid to measure

their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns of Afia.
