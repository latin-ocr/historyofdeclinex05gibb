OF THE ROMAN ΙΞΜΡΙΚΙΞν

native of fiekness' and pleasure‚ A fair and noble widow had ac-
companied Constantine in his exile to the isse of Lesbos, and Sele..
rena gloried in the appellation of his mistress. After his marriage
and elevation‚ she was invested with the title and pomp of Augsstoe,
and occupied a contiguous apartment in the palace. The lau-fel
