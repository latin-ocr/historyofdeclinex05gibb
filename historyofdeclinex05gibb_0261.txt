first hour of his miffion, to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle
was never forsaken by a gememus friend, whom he delighted to
name his brother, his vicegerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second
RIoses. The son of Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for [168]εᾶ-
ing to secure his interest by a solemn declaration of his right, which
*would have silenced all competition, and sealed his succeffion by the
decrees of heaven. But the unsuspeffing hero confided in himself:
the jealousy of exnpire, and perhaps the fear of opposition, might
suspend the resolutione of Mahornet3 and the bed of fickness was
besieged by the artful Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker, and the

on the choice of his successor. The hereditary claim and lofty
spirit of Ali, were offenfive to an aristocracy of elders, defirous of
bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent eledion:
the Koreish could never be reconciled to the proud pre-eminence of
the line of Hashem3 the ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled5

respeefive merit-s, and the rash proposal of chufiug two independent
caliphs would have crushed in their infancy the religion and empire
of the Saracens. The tumult was appensed by the difinterested re-
solution of Omar, who, suddenly renouncing his own pretenfions,
stretched forth his hand, and declared himself the first subjeft of
the rnild and venerable Abubeker. The urgency of the moment,

and the acquiescence of the people, might excuse this illegal and pre-

sentences, which he ascribes, with some hesi· transsator: yet these sentences &th-este a
ration, to Ali, ‚the son of Abu Taleb. His characteristic, though dxtrk, {neme cf human
preface is coloured by the enthufiasm of a life.
