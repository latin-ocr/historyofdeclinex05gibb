THE DECLINE AND FALL

The merit and effe& of a copy depends on its resemblance with
the origina13 but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the ge-
nuine features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles: the

⁴ statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine⁷ was more probably that

of some temporal saviour; the Gnostics and their profane monu-
ments were reprobated ; and the fancy of the Christian artists could
only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model.
In this distress, abold and dext-trous invention affin-ed at once the
likeness of the image and the'innocence of the worship. A new
superstruCture of fable was raised on the popular baiis of a Syrian
legend, on the correspondence of Christ and Abgarus, so famous

in the days of Eusebius, so relu&antly desei-ted by our modern ad·-
vocates. The bishop of Caesarea ⁸ records the epistle ⁹, but he most
strangely forgets the pffimre, of Christ ¹⁰3 the perse& impression of

his

I do not find any notice of the Syriae origi-
nal or the archives os Edessa (Bibliot. Orient.

⁷ After removing some rubbish of miracle
end inconsistency, it may be allowed, that as

late as the year 300, Paneas in Palestine was
decorated with a bronze natue, representing
a grave personage wrapt in a cloak, with a
grateful or suppliant female kneeling before
him, and that an inscription—eq) Σωτῆρι, τῳ
svzpyerp-—was perhaps inscribed on the pedes-
tal. By the christinus, this groupe was fool-
ishly explained of their founder and the poor
woman whom he had cured of the bloody
{lux (Euseb. vii. 18. Philostorg. vii. 3, &c.).
M. de Beausobre more reasonably conjectures
the philosopher Apollonius, or the emperor
Vespasian: in the latter supposition, the fe-
male is a city, a province, or perhaps the
queen Berenice (Bibliotheque Germanique,
tom. xiii. p. 1—92.).

⁸ Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. i. c. ¹3· The
learned Assemannus has brought up the col-
lateral aid of three Syrians, St. Ephrem, Jo-
sua stylites, and James bishop os Sarug3 but

tom. i. p. 3¹8· 4²0· 354.); their vague be-
lief is probably derived from the Greeks,

⁹ 'she evidence for these epistles is stated
and rejected by the candid Lardner (Heathen
Testimonies, vol. i. p. 297—309.).' Among
the herd of bigots who are forcibly driven
from this convenient, but untenable‚ post,
1 am affiamed, with the Grabes, Caves, Til-
lernonts, «Sec. to discover Mr. Addison, an
English gentleman (his W'orks, vol. i. p. 528.
Baskerville's edition) ; but his superficial tra&
on the Christian religion owes its credit to his
name, his style, and the interested applause
of our clergy.

¹⁰ From the silence of James of Sarug
(Asseman. Bibliot. Orient. p. 289. 318.),
and the testimony of Evagrius (Hist. Eccles.

l. iv. c. 27.)‚ Ι conclude that this fable was
invented between the years 52¹ and 594,

most probably aster the siege of Edessa inr
