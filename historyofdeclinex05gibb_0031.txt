or THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 27

On earth, the crime of Irene was left five years unpunissied3 C fHfl P.-
her reign was crowned with external splendour3 and if she could Q
filence the voice of conscience, {he neither heard nor regarded the
reproaches of mankind. The Roman world bowed to the govern-

ment of a female3 and as she moved through the streets of Con-
stantinople, the reins of four milk-white steeds were held by as
