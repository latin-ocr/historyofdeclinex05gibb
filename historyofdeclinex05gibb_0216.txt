marvellous tale33 but the gravcst of the Musulman doCtors imitate
the modessy of their master, and indulge a latitude of saith or in-
terpretatior1¹⁵⁰. They might speciously allege, that in preaching the
religion, it was needless to violate the harmony, of nature; that a
creed unclouded with mystery may be excused from miracles; and
that the sword of Mahomet was not less potent than the rod of
Moses.

The polytheist is oppress'ed and distraCted by the variety of super-
stition: a thousand rites of Egyptian origin were interwoven with
the effence of the Mosaie law ; and the spirit of the gospel had eva-
porated in the pageantry os the church. The prophet of Mecea

p. 638.). This figure of rhetoric has been
converted inxo a faa, which is said to be at·

still celebrated by the Persians (Chardin,

ly spun out by Gagnier (vie de Mahomet,
tom. i. p. 183—234.) on the saith, as it
