cording to the tradition of the nocturnal journey, the apostle, in his C H A Ρ,
personal conference with the Deity, was commanded to impose on ι.,...,Ῑ”..’, ,
his disciples the daily obligation of fifty prayers. By the advice of
hides, he applied for an alleviation of this intolerable burthen3
the number was gradually reduced to five3 without any dispensation
of bufiness or pleasure‚ or time or place: the devotion of the faithfuk
is repeated at day-break, at noon, in the astemoon, in the evening,

religious fervour, our travellers are edified by the profound humility
and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness is the key of

towards a kebla, or vifible point of the horizon. The prophet was
at first inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem 3 but
he soon returned to a more natural partiality; and five times every
