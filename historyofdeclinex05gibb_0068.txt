refusal of Alexius to march against a fourth rebel, the hulband of his
fister, destroyed the merit or mernory of his past services: thc fa-
vourites of Botaniates provoked the ambition which they apprehended
and accused; and the retreat of the two brothers might be justified
by the defenee of their lise or liberty. The women of the family
were deposited in a sanEtuary, respected by tyrants : the men,
mounted on horseback‚ sallied from the city, and erensted the standard
of civil war. The soldier& who had been gradually affembled in the
capital and the neighbourhood, were devoted to the cause of a vic-
torious and injured leader ε the ties of common interest and domestic
alliance secured the attachment of the house of Ducas3 and the ge-
nerous dispute of the Comneni was terminated by the decifive reso-
lution of Isaac, who was the first to invest his younger brother with
the name and enfigns of royalty. They returned to Constandnople,
to threaten rather than besiege that impregnablc fortress3 but the
fidelity of the guards was corrupted; a gate was surprised3 and the
fleet was occupied by the affitive courage of George Palaeologus, who
fought against his father, without foreseeing that he laboured for his

disappeared in a monastery. An army of various nations was gra-

a laudable zeal to perpetuate his virtues. Conscious of the just fus-
picion of her readers, the princess·Anne Comnena repeatedly pro-
