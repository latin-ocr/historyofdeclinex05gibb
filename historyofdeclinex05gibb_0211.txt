was transsated to the seventh heaven ⁵³.
the gospel was the way of truth and salvation 3 but the Christians
insenfibly forgot both the laws and the example of their founder;
and Mahomet was instrudted by the Gnostics to accuse the church,
as wellas the synagogue, of corrupting the integrity of the sacred
text ²³⁹. The piety of Moses and of Christ rejoiced in the affurance
of a future prophet, more illustrious than themselves: the evangelie
promise of the Paradae, or Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name,
and accomplished in the person, of Mahomet ⁹⁰, the greatest and the
last of the apostles of God.

v. r56. ofMaracci’s edition. Deus estpraestan-
tiffimus dolose agentium (an odd praise) .. . .
nec crucifixerunt eum, sed objecta est eis fimi-
litudo: an expression that may suit with the
system of the Docetes; but the commentators
believe (Maracci, tom.ii. p. 113—115. 173.
Sale, p.42. 43. 79.), that another man, a
friend or an enemy, was crucified in the like-
ness of Jesus; a fable which they had read
in the gospel of St. Barnabas, and which
had been started as early as the tirne of Ire-
naeus, by some Ebionite heretics (Beausobre,
Hist. du Manicheisme‚ tom. ii. p. 25· Mo-
sheim de Reb. Christ. p. 353.).

⁸⁹ This charge is obscurely urged in the
Koran (c. 3. p.45.): but neither Mahomet,
nor his followers, are sufficiently versed in

languages and criticism to give any weight or
colour to their suspicions. Yet the Arians
and Nestorians could relate some stories, and
the illiterate prophet might listen to the bold
assertions of the Manichaeans. See Beausobre,
torn.i. p.z91——305.

⁹⁰ Among the prophecies of the Old and
New Testament, which are perverted by the
fraud or ignorance of the Musulmans, they
apply to the prophet the promise of the Pars:-
clete, or Comforter, which had been already
usurped by the Montanists and Manichmans
(Beausobre‚ Hist. critique du Mafficheism.
tom.i. p. 263, Sec.) ; and the easy change of
letters, περικλυτος for παρακλκτοτ, affords the
etymology of the name of Mohammed (Ma-
raeci, tom.i. parti. p.15—28.).
