THE DECLINE AND FALL

C Η, Α, P. celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and Bellarmine ²¹3 and if they

x-—wssa are asked, why the same thunders were not hurled against the Neros

and Julians of antiquity? they reply, that the weakness of the pri-
mitive church was the sole cause of her patient loyalty ²⁸. On this
occaslon, the effecrs of love and hatred are the same ; aud the zealous
protestants, who seek to kindle the indignation, and to alarm the
fears, of princes and magistrates, expatiate on the insolence and
‘treason of the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign ²⁹. They
are defended only by the moderate catholicas, for the most part, of
the Gallican church³⁰‚ who respect the saint, without approving
the sm. These common advocates of the crown and the mitre
circumscribe the truth of faCts by the rule of equity, scripture,
and tradition; and appeal to the evidence of the Latins³⁸‚ and the ’

¹lives ³² and epistles of the popes themselves. T

Yet such is the change os Italy, that Sigo-

the pope.

Ἐ Qod sn Christiani olim non deposuerunt
Neronem aut Julianum, id fuit quia deerant
vires temporales Christianis (honest Bellar-
mine, de Rom. Pont. l. v. c. 7.). Cardinal
Perron adds a distinction more honourable to
the first Christians, but not more satissaelory
ro modern princes—the treassm of heretics
and apostates‚ who break their cath, belie
their coin, and renounce their allegiance to
Christ and his vicar (Petroniana, p. 89.).

²⁹ Take, as a specimen, the cautious Bas-
nage (Hist. de l'Eglise, p. 1390, ¹35¹·) and
the vehement Spanheim (Hist. imaginum),
who, with an hundred more, tread in the
footsteps of the centuriators os Magdeburgh.

216.)‚ and Giannone (Istoria Civile di Na·
poli, tom.i. p. 317—320.), a disciple os the
Gallican school. In the field of controversy
Ι always pity the moderate party, who stand
on the open middle ground exposed to the
fire of both fides. ·

approve the Greek text of Theophanes.
