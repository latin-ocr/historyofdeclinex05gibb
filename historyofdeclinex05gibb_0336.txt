among sive of the lioreish3 but the proof of resemblance adjudged
the child to Aafi the oldest of her lovers ⁹⁶. The youth of Amrou
was impelled by the paffions and prejudices of his kindretl: his i
poetic genius was exercised in satirical verses against the person and
doctrine of Mahomet; his dexterity was employed by the reigning·
faetion to pursue the religious exiles who had taken refuge in the
court of the AEthiopian- king’⁷. Yet he returned from this embaffy, ’
a secret proselyte; his reason or his interest determined him to re-
nounce the worship of idols; he escaped from Mecca with his friend‘
Called, and the prophet of Medina enjoyed at the same moment the*
satisfaffion of embracing the two firmest champions of his cause.
The impatience of Amrou to lead the armies of the faithful, was
checked by the reproof of Omar, who advised him not to seek power
and dominion, fince he who is a subject to·day, may be a prince
tomorrow. Yet his merit was not overlooked by the two first sue-
cessors of Mahomet; they were indebted to his arms for the con-
quest of Palestine3 and in all the battles andfieges of Syria, he
united with the temper of a chief, the valour of an adventurous
soldier. In a visit to Medina, the caliph expreffed a wilh to survey
the sword which had cut down so many Christian warriors: the son
of Aasr unsheathed a short and ordinary scymetar ; and as he per-
ccived the surprise of Omar, “ Alas‚” said the modest Saracen, “ the:>
“ sword itfelf‚ without the arm of its master, is neither sharper
