of the Koran; and the prophet was forced to reprove the indecent
vehemence of his disciples. If the ssightest credit may be afforded
to the traditione of his wives and companions‚ he maintained, in
the bosom of his family, and to the last moments of his life, the

expreffed his lively confi'dence, not only of the mercy, but of the
favour, of the Supreme Being. I⁴n a familiar discourse he had

army halted at the gates of Medina ; the chiefs were affembled round

their dying master, The city, more especially the house, of the pro--
