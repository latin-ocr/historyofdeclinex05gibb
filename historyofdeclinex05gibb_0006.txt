§.W At every step, as we smk deeper in the decline and fall of the

Eastern empire, the annals of each succeeding reign would impose
a more ungrateful and melancholy task. These annals must con-
tinue to repeat a tedious and uniform tale of weakness and misery;
the natural conneffion of causes and events would be broken by
frequent and hasty tranfitions‚ and a minute accumulation of cir-
cumstances must destroy the light and effe& of those general pictures
which compose the use and ornament of a remote history. From
the time of Heraclius, the Byzantine theatre is conti-acted and
darkened: the line of empire, which had been defined by the laws
of Justinian and the arms of Belisarius‚ recedes on all fides from our
view z the Roman name, the proper subject of our enquiries, is re-
duced to a narrow corner of Europe, to the lonely suburbs of Con·
stantinople 3 and the fate of the Greek empire has been compared to
that of the Rhine, which loses itseIf in the sands, before its waters
can mingle with the ocean. The scale of dominion is diminished to
our view by the distance of time and place : nor is the loss of exter-
nal splendour compensated by the nobler gifts of virtue and genius.
In the last moments of her decay, Constantinople was doubtless more
opulent and populous than Athens at her most flourishing aera, when
a scanty sum of fix thousand talents, or twelve hundred thousand
pounds sterling, was posseffed by twenty-one thousand male citizens
of an adult age. But each os these citizens was a freeman, who
dared to affert the liberty of his thoughts, words, and aetions3 whose
person and property were guarded by equal law; and who exer-
cised his independent vote in the government of the republic. Their
numbers seem to be multiplied by the strong and various discriminati0ns
of character: under the shield of freedom, on the wings of emulation
and vanity, each Athenian aspired to the level of the national dignity:
from this commanding eminence, some chosen spirits soared beyond the
