THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P. presented to the tribes: each Arab was free to ele& or to compose

L

κ--ᾆ-α his private religion: and the rude superstition of his house was

mingled with the sublime theology of saints and philosophers. A
fundamental article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the
learned stranger83 the existence of one supreme God, who is ex-
alted above the powers of heaven and earth, but who has often re-
vealed himself to mankind by the ministry of his augeb¹ and pro-
phets, and whose grace or justice has interrupted‚ by seasonable mi-
racles, the order of nature. The most rational of the Arabs ac-
knowledged his power, though they neglected his worship ⁶⁸3 and it
was habit rather than convi&ion that still attached them to the relies
of idolatry. The Jews and Christians were the people of the book
the bible was already transsated into the Arabic language ⁶², and the
volume of the old testament was accepted by the concord of these
implacable enemies. In the story of the Hebrew patriarchs‚ the
Arabs were pleased to discover the fathers of their nation. They
applauded the birth and promises of Ismael; revered the faith and
virtue of Abraham3 traced his pedigree and their own to the crea-
tion of the first man, and imbibed with equal credulity, the pro·-

digiesof the holy text, and the dreams and traditions of the Jewisti
rabbis.

more potent, but a more irritable patron

or Christian, appear more recent than the
Koran3 but the existence of a prior transsa-

tion may be fairly inserted, ι. From the per-
