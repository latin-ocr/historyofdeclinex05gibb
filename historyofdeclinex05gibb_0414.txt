fire ¹⁶. The important secret of compounding and directing this arti-
ficial flame was imparted by Callinicus, a native of Heliopolis in
Syria, who deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the

emperor ¹⁷.

The sszill of a chymist and engineer was equivalent to
the succour of fleets and armies; and this discovery or improve-
ment of the military art was fortunately reserved for the distressful
period, when the degenerate Romans of the East were incapable of
contending with the warlike enthusiasm and youthful vigour of the
Saracens. The historian who presumes to analize this extraordinary
composition should suspect his own ignorance and that of his Byzan-
tine guides, so prone to the marvellous, so careless, and, in this in-
stance, so jealous of the truth. - From their obscure, and perhaps fal-
lacious hints, it should seem that the principal ingredient of the

Greek fire was the naptha ¹⁸, or liquid bitumen, a light, tenacious‚

James de Vitry (1.iii. c. 84.), is introduced
on ssight evidence and strong probability.
Cinnamus (1. vi. p. 165.) calls the Greek fire
πυρ Μηδ.κω; and the naptha is known to
abound between the Tigris and the Caspian

Sea.
