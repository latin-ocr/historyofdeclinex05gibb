of the Exarchate⁶³ might comprise all the provinces of Italy which
had obeyed the emperor and his viccgcrcnt3 but its stri& and pro-

Ferrara: its inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which
stretched along the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona, and advanced
into the midland country as far as the ridges of the Apennine. In
this transaffion, the ambition and avarice of the popes has been
severely condemned. Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest
should have rejeeted an earthly kingdom, which it was not easy for
him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his profeffion.
Perhaps a faithful subje&, or even a genereus enemy, would have
been less impatient to divide the spoils of the Bar-barian 3 and if the
emperor had entrusted Stephen to solicit in his name the restitution
of the Exarchate, Ι will not absolve the pope from the reproach of
treachery and falsehood. But in the rigid interpretation of the laws,
every one may accept, without injury, whatever his benefae‘mr can

soul. The splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute
