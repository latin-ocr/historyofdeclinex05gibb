THE DECLINE AND FALL

nenian family, the historic muse of Constantinople again revives, but
her apparel is gaudy, hci- rnotions are without elegance or grace. A
succession of priests, or courtierS, trcads in each other's footsteps i'n
the same path of servitude and superstition : their views are narrow,
their judgment is feeble or corrupt3 and we close the volume of
copious barrenness, still ignorant of the causes of events, the cha-
racters of the actore, and the manners of the times, which they ce-
lebrate or deplere. The observation which has been applied to a
man, may be extended to a whole people, that the energy of th’e
sword is communicated to the pen 3 and it will be found by expcrience„
that the tonc of history will rise or fall with the spirit of the age.

From these consideratione, Ι should have abandoned without re-
gret the Greek ssaves aud their servile historians, had I not reflec‘ted
that the fate of the Byzantine monarchy is paffi‘veh' connected with
the most splendid and important revolutions which have changed v
the state of the world. The space of the lost provinces was imme-
diately replenissied with new colonies and rising kingdoms: the
active virtues of peace and war deserted from the vanquished to the
victorious ‘nations3 and it is in their origin and conquests, in their
religion and government‚ that we must explore the causes and effec‘ts
of the decline and fall of the Eastern empire. Nor will this scope of'
narrative, the riches and variety of these materials‚ be incompatilzle
with the unity cf defign and composition. As, in his daily prayers,
the lNffusulinan of Fez or Delhi still turns his face towards the temple
of Mecca, the historian's eye 'shall be always fixed on the city of
Constantinople. The excurlive line may embrace the wilds of Arabia
and Tartary‚ but the circle will be ultimately reduced to the de-
creasmg limit of the Roman monarchy.

On this principle Ι shall now establiffi the plan of the two last
volumes of the present work. The first chapter will contain‚ in a
regular series, the· emperors who reigned· at Constantinople during-a

period
