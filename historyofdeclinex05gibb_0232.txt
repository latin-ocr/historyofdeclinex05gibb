was in the same camp that the deputy of Mecca was astonished by
the attention of the faithful to the words and looks of the prophet,
by the eagerness with which they collected his spittle, an hair that
dropt on the ground, the refuse water of his lustrations, as if they
participated in some degree of the prophetie virtue. “ Ι have seen,”

arms, his person and his poffeffions; to repel, or even to prevent,
the violence of his enemies, and to extend his hostilities to a rea-

sonable measure of satisfaction and retaliation. In the free society of
