the death of four hundred and seventy Mossems was compensated

by the opinion that they had sent to hell above fifty thousand of

the infidels. The spoil was inestimable3 many banners and crosses

of gold and sllver, precious stones, filver and gold chains, and in-

a stratagem or an affault3 or to expect the progress of famine and
discontent. Damascus would have acquiesced in the trial of Aizna-
din, as a final and peremptory sentence between the emperor and

the caliph: her courage was rekindled by the example and authority
