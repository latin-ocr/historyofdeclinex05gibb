and Rome, were involved 1n a cloud of ignerance3 the doctrine of
Cypriam and Augustin was no longer studied Five hundred epi-

scopal churchcs were overturned by the-hostile fury of the Donatists‚
the Vandals, and the Moors. The zea] and numbers of the clergy
declined ; and the people, without discipline, or knowledge, or hope,
submisfively sunk under the yoke of the Arabian'prophet. Within
fifty years after the expulfion of the Greeks, a lieutenant of Africa
informed the caliph that the tribute of the infidels was abolished by
their converfion ²⁰⁷3 and, though he sought to disguise his, fraud and

tenfive progress of the Mahometan saith. In the next age, an extra-
ordinary miffion of five biihops was detachedfrom Alex‘andria to
Cairoan. They were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch to eherissr
and revive the dying cmbers of Christianity ²⁰⁸: but the interposi-

thage, implored the alme and the protection of the Vatican3 and
he bitterly complains that his naked body -had been scourged by the

'Sarac-ens, and thatxhis authority was disputed by the four suffragans,
