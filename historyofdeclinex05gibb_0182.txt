reigned in Mecca, were conspicuous among the Arabian tribes ; but
their ungrateful soil refused the labours of agriculture, and their po-

Gedda, at the distance only of forty miles, they maintained an easy
correspondence with Abyffinia ; and that Christian kingdom afforded
the first refuge to the disciples of Mahomet. The treasures of Africa
were conveyed over the peninsula to Gerrha or Katif, in the prffi'i-nce
of Bahrein‚ a city built, as it is said, of rock—salt, by the Chaldean
exiles ¹⁹: and from thence, with the native pearls of the Persian
Gulf, they were floated on rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates.
Mecca is placed almost at an equal distance, a month's journey, be-

their seasonable arrival relicved the ships of India from the tedious
and troublesome navigation of the Red Sea. In the markets of
Saana and Merab‚ in the harbours of Oman and Aden, the camels
of the Koreishites were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics; a

in the streets of Mecca ; and the noblest of her sons united the love
of arms with the profeflion of merchandise ²⁰.
