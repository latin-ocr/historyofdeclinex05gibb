of Guiscard have been already defined ; they were contained in this
second occaslon in one hundred and twenty vessels ; and as the sea-
son was far advanced, the harbom- of Brundusium ⁹⁰ was preferred

to the open road of Otranto. Alexius, apprehenslve of a second
attack‚ had affiduoussy laboured to restore the naval forces of the

empire; and obtained from the republic of Venice an important suc-
cour of thirty-fix transports„ fourteen gallies, and nine galeots or
ssiips of extraordinary strength and magnitude. Their services were
iiberally paid by the licence or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift
of m'any shops and houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tri-
bute to St. Mark, the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a
tax on their rivals of Amalphi. By the union of the Greeks and

admirable port of Brundusium was double;
,the outward harbour was a gulph covered by

inner hai-bour, which embraced the city on

for its tuing and against such agents, what
are the feeble efforts of the Neapolitan go-
