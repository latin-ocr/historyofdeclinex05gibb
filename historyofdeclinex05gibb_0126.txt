popes·

THE DECLINE AND FALL

he dismounted from his horse, led the procession of h‘is nobles to
the Vaticau, and, as he aseended the stairs, devoutly kiffed eachstep
of the threshold of the apostles. In the portico, Adrian expeaed him
at the head of his clergy ε they embraced, as friends'and equa185 but
in their march to the altar, the king or patriciam assumed the right·-
hand of the pope. Nor was the Frank content with these vain and
empty demonstrations of respec‘t. In the twenty-fix years that
elapsed, between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial coro-
nation‚ Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subjest,
as his own, to the sceptre, of Charlemagne. The people swore alle·-
giance to his person and family: in his name money was coined,
and justice was administered5 and the electiori of the popes was exa·-
mined and confirmed by his authority. Except an original and self-
inherent claim of sovereignty‚ there was not any prerogative re-
maining, which the title of emperor could add to the patrician of
Rome ⁶¹. ⁷

The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these obliga-
tions, and their names are consecrated, as the saviours and bene-
fad'mrs of the Roman church. Her anclent patrimony of farms and
houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal dominion
of cities and provinces3 and the donation of the exarchate was the
first fruits of the conquests of Pepin ⁶². Astolphus with a figh relin-
quissied his prey; the keys and the hostages of the principa! cities

θ’ Paulus Diaconus, who wrote before the ⁶² Mosheim (InstitutionHist. Eccles. p.263.)
cmpirc of Ch.1rlemagne, describes Rome as weighs this donation with fair and deliberate
his subjetft city—vestra: ciritares (ad Pompe· prudence. The original a& has never been
ium Festum), suis addidit sceptris (de Meten- produced; but the Liber l'onriiicalis repre-
fis Ecclefiae Episcopis). Some Carlovingian sents (p. 171.), and the Codex Carolinus
medals, struck at Rome, have engaged Le suppose9‚ this ample gift. Both are con—
Blanc to write an elaborate, though partin, temporary records; and the latter is the
dissertation on their authority at Rome, both more annuende, fince it has been preserved,
υ patriciam and emperors (Amsscrdam,1(>9z‚ ¹¹01 5¹¹ ‘he P³P21¹1 but the Imperial, Iibfflsy·
