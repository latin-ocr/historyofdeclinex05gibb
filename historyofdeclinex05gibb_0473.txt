nant to expect, without impatience, the return of spring. But in ι--Ν
the depth of winter, in a dark and rainy night, an adventurous

subaltern, with three hundred sold-iem, approached the rampart, ap—
plied his scaling-ladders, occupied two adjacent towers, stood firm
against the pressure of multitudes‚ and bravely maintained his post
till he was relieved by the tardy, though effectual, support of his
reluctant chief. The first tumult of ssaughter and rapine subfided3 Ξξῖξέςᾭ of

was deserted; and, while they furioussy charged each other in the
market—place‚ they were surprised and destroyed by the sword of a
common enemy. The male sex was exterminated hythe sword ;
ten thousand youths were led into captivity; the weight of the pre-
cious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the beasts of bur-

and bleeding city. In their Syriam inroads they commanded the
husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they themselves, in the
