300 THE DECLINE ΛΝΒ FALL

C ῙῖΙΑ Ρ· the dismay and disorder of the Christians. With the loss of two

Q hundred and thirty men, the Arabs remained masters of the fie1d;
and the ramparts of Bosra, in expectation of human or divine aid,
were crowded with holy croffes and consecrated banners. The go-
vernor Romanus had recommended an early submiffion: despised
by the people‚ and degraded from his office, he still retained the
desire and opportunity of revenge. In a nocturnal interview, he in-
formed the enemy of a subterraneous passage from his house under
the wall of the city; the son of the caliph, with an hundred vo-
lunteers, were committed to the saith of this new ally, and their
successful intrepidity gave an easy entrance to their companions.
After ‘Caled had imposed the terms of servitude and tribute, the
apostate or convert avowed in the affembly of the people his meri-

. torious treason. “ Irenounce your society‚'’ said Romanus, “ both
“ in this world, and the world to come. And I deny him that was
“ crucified, and whosoever worssiips him. And I chuse God for
“ my Lord‚ Issam for my faith, Mecca for my temple, the Mossems
“ for my brethren, and Mahomet for my prophet3 who was sent
“ to lead us into the right way, and to exalt the true religion in
“ spite of those who join partners with God.’'
