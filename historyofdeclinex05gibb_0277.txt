the Turkish dome of St. Sophia, with an encrease of splendor and fize, μ-ν--ι
represents the humble tabernacle erected at M'edina by the hands of
Mahomet. The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the tempt-
ation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to a level
with the senses and imagination of man. “ I believe in one God,
“ and Mahomet the apostle of God‚” is the simple and invariable·
profession of Issam. The intellee'mal image of the Deity has never
been degraded by any vifible idol; the honours of the prophet have
never transgressed the measure of human virtue3 and his living pre-
cepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bound&
of reason and religion. The votaries of Ali have indeed consecrated
the memory of their hero, his wife, and his children, and some of
the Perfian doctors pretend that the divine effence was incarnate in
the person of the Imarns3· but their superstition is universally con—-
demned by the Sonnites 3 and* their impiety has afforded a seasonablc
*warning against the worship of saints and martyrs. The metaphy-›·
sical questions on the attributes of God, and the liberty of man,
have been agitated in the schools of the Mahometans, as well as in
those of the Christiane· 3 but among the former they have never en-
gaged the pallions of the people or disturbed the tranquillity of tlte
flate. The cause of this important difference may be found in the
separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters. It was
the interest of the caliphs, the succefl'ors os the prophet and comu
manders of the faithful, to repress and discoizrage all religious innow
vations: the order, the discipline, the temporal and spiritual anibi-
tion of the clergy, are unknown to the Mossems3 and the sagos
of the law are the guides of their conscience and the oracles of their
ἱιὶῐῐι. From the Atlantic to the Ganges, the Koran is acknowledged
as the fundamental code, not only of theology but os civil and cri-⁶
