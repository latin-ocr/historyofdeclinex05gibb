496 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 131¹? P. venial transgressions, of their sovereign. The Greek ecclefiastics

W were themselves the subje&s of the civil magistrate: at the nod of
a tyrant, the bissrops were created, or transferred, or deposed, or
punished, with an ignominious death: whatever might be their
wealth or influence, they could never succeed like the Latin clergy
in the establishment of an independent republic; and the patriarch
of Constantinople condemned, what he seeretly envied, the tempora}
greatness of his Roman brother. Yet the exereise of boundless des-
potism is happily checked by the laws of nature and necessity. In
proportion to his wisdom and virtue, the master of an empire is
confined to the path of his sacred and laborious duty. In propor-

his private interest to exercise the task of the public oppression. In
some fatal moment, the most absolute monarch may dread the reason
or the caprice of a nation of ssaves; and experienee has proved, that
whatever is gained in the extent, is lost in the safety and solidity, of

of Charlemagne to that of the Crusades, the world (forI overlook
the remote monarchy of China) was occupied and disputed by the
three great empires or nations of the Greeks, the Saracens, and the
Franks. Their military strength may be ascertained by a comparison
of their coniuge, their arts and riches, and their obedience to a su-
preme head, who might call into aetion all the energies of the state.
The Greeks, far inferior to their rivals in the first, were superior to
the Franks, and at least equal to the Saracens, in the second and

third of these warlike qualifications.
