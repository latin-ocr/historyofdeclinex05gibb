The patrimonial estate of Hugo was reduced from the monarchy of
France to the slmple county of Arles; though it was not denied,
that, in the confufion of the times, he had usurped the sovereignty
of Provence, and invaded the kingdom of Italy. His father was
a private noble; and if Bertha derived her female descent from the
Carlovingian line, every step was polluted with illegitimacy or vice.
The grandmother of Hugo was the famous valdrada, the concu-

bine, rather than the wife, of the second Lothair3 whose adustery,
divorce, and second nuptials‚ had provoked against him the rhun-
ders of the Vatican. His mother, as ssie was styled the great Ber-
tha‚ was succeffively the wife of the count of Arles and of the
marquis of Tuscany: France and Italy were scandalised by her gal-
lantrie53 and, till the age of threescore‚ her lovers, of every de-
gree, were the zealous servants of her ambition. The example of
maternal incontinence was copied by the king of Italy3 and the
three favourite concubines of Hugo were decorated with the claffic
names of Venus, Juno² and Semele ⁶³. The daughter of Venus was
granted to the solicitations of the Byzantine court: her name of
Bertha was changed to that of Eudoxia; and she was wedded, or
rather betrothed, to young Romanus, the future heir of the empire
of the East. The consummation of this foreign alliance was sus-
pended by the tender age of the two parties; and, at the end of
five years, the union was diffolved by the death of the virgin

life of the illustrious king Hugo mfssmnw nati ex incertis patribus originem ducunt
