OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 599

Coutanees‚ in the lower Normandy: the castle of Hauteville was 0 ῗνῗὶ P·
their honourable seat; his father Tancred was conspicuous in the J-tpa
court and army of the duke3 and his military service was furnissied
by ten sol‘diers or knights. Two marriages‚ of a rank not unworthy
of his own, made him the father of twelve sons, who were educated·

at once, and with. equal dexterity, could wield in the right-hand-
his sword, his lance in the left3 that in the battle of Civitella‚ he

was thrice unhorsed5 and that in the close of that memorable day
