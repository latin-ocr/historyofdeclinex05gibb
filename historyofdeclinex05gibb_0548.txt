A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the
value of their reformation‚ will prudently ass< from what articles of
faith, above or agai7st our reason, they have enfranchised the Chris-
tians ; for such enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so far as it
may be compatible with truth and piety. After a fair discuffion we
shall rather be surprised by the timidity‚ than scandalised by the free-
dom, of our first reformers ³². With the Jews, they adopted the
belief and defence of all the Hebrew scriptur-es, with all their pro-
digies, from the garden of Eden to the vifions of the prophet
Daniel; and they were bound, like the Carbones, to justify against
the Jews the abolition of a divine law. In the great mysteries of the
Trinity and Incarnation the reformers were severely orthodox : they
freely adopted the theology of the four, or the fix first councils 3 and
with the Athanafian creed, they pronounced the eternal damnation
of all who did not believe the Catholic faith. Transubstantiation‚ the
invifible change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of
Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument and plea-·
santry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their sense5‚ of
their sight, their feeling, and their taste‚ the first protestante. were
entangled in their own seruples, and awed by the words of Jesus in
the institution of the sacrament. Luther maintained a corporeal, and
Calvin a real, presence of Christ in the eucharist3 and the opinion
of Zuinglius‚ that it is no more than a spiritual communion, a slm-
ple memorial, has ssowly prevailed in the reformed churches³³. But
