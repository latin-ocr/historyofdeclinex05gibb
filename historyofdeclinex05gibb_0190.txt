THE DECLINE AND FALL

interest and principal of the bloody debt are accumulated ; the indivi-
duals of either family lead alife of malice and suspicion, and fifty years
may sometimes elapse before the account of vcngeance be finally
settled ³⁷. This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has
been moderated, however, by the maxims of honour, which require
in every private encounter some decent equality of age and strength,
of numbers and weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of four,
months, was observed by the Arabs before the time of Mahomet,
during which their swords were religioussy sheathed both in foreign
and domestic hostility3 and this partial truce is more strongly ex-

pressive of the habits of anarchy and warfare ³²³.

But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder
influence of trade and literature. The solitary peninsula is encom-
paffed by the most civilized nations of the ancient world ; the mer-
chant is the friend of mankind3 and the annual caravans imported
the first seeds of knowledge and politeness into the eides, and even
the camps of the desert. NVhatever may be the pedigree of the
Arabs, their language is derived from the same original stock with
the Hebrew, the Syriae, and the Chaldaean tongues; the independ-
ence of the tribes was marked by their peculial· dialects³⁹ ςἶ but each„

after their own, allowed a just preference to the pure and perspicuous

³⁷ The modern theory and prastice of the
Arabs in the revenge of murder, are de-
scribed by Niebuhr (Descriptiom p. 26—
31.). The harsher features of antiquity may
be naced in the Koran, c. 2. p. 20. c. ¹7·
p. 230. with Sale’s Observaticns.

³¹ Procopius (de Bell. Persic. l. i. c. 16.)
places the two holy months about the sum-
mer solstice. The Arabians consecrate four
months of the year—the first, severim, ele-
venth‚ and twelsth; and pretend, that in a
long series os ages the truce was infringed
only four or fix times (Sale’s Preliminary
Distourse, p. 147—150. and Notes on the

³⁹ Arrian, in the second century, remarks
(in Periplo Maris Erythraei, p. ιε.) the par-
tial or total difference of the dialects of the
Arabs. Their language and letters are co-
pioussy treated by Pocock (specimen, p. ¹50
——154.), Cafiri (Bibliot. Hispano-Arabica,
tom. i. p. ι. 83. ²92· tom. ii. p. 25, δια),
