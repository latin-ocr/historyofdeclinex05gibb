OF THE ROMAN ΕΜΡΙΚΕ.

At the conclusion of the life of Mahomet‚ it may perhaps be ex-
peeted, thatI should balance his faults and virtues, that Ι should
decide whether the title of enthufiast or impostor more properly be-
longs to that extraordinary man. Had Ι been intimately conversant
with the son of Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the
success uncertain ε at the distance of twelve centuries‚ I darkly con-
template his {hade through a cloud of religious incense3 and could
I truly delineate the portrait of an honr, the fieeting resemblance
would not equally apply to the solitary of mount Hera, to the
preacher of Mecca, and to the conqueror of Arabia. The author of
a mighty revolution appears to have been endowed with a pious and
contemplative dispofition z so soon as marriage had raised him above
the preffure of want, he avoided the paths of ambition and avarice ;

and till the age of forty‚ he lived with innocence, and would have

died without a name. The unity of God is an idea most congenial
to nature and reason3 and a ssight conversation with the Jews and
Christians would teach him to despise and detest the idolatry of
Mecca. It was the duty of a man- and a citizen to impart the doc-
trine of salvati0n‚ to rescue his country from the dominion of sm
and error. The energy of a mind incefl'antly bent on the same ob-
je&‚ would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the
warm suggestions of the understanding or the fancy, would be felt
as the inspirations of heaven; the labour of thought would expire
in rapture and vil'ron; and the inward sensation, the invisible mo·-
nitor, would be described with t'he form and attributes of an angel
of God ¹⁵⁴. From enthufiasm to imposture, the step is perilous and
