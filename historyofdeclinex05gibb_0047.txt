OF THE ROMAN EMPIRF„

rious stag entangled his horns in the belt of Bafil, and raised him
from his horse: he was rescued by an attendant, who cut the belt
and ssew the animal 3 but the fall, or the sever, exhausted the strength
‘of the aged monarch, and he expired in the palace, amidst the tears
of his family and people. If he struck off the head of the faithful
servant, for presuming to draw his sword against his sovereign3 the
pride of despofism, which had lain dormant in his life, revived in
the last moments of despair, when he no longer wanted or valued the
opinion of mankind.

Of the four sons of the emperor, Constantine died before his
father, whose grief and credulity were amused by a flattering irn-
postor and a vain apparition. Stephen‚ the youngest, was content
with the honours of a patriarch and a saint3 both Leo and Alex-
ander were alike invested with the purple, but the powers of govern-
ment were solely exercised by the elder brother. The name of Leo
the fixth has been dignified with the title of philqffiph‘er ,- and the
union of the prince and the sage, of the aetive and speculative vir-
tues, would indeed constitute the perfeffion of human nature. But
the claims of Leo are far {hort of this ideal excellence. Did he re-
duce his paffions and appetites under the dominion of reason? His
life was spent in the pomp of the palace, in the society of his wives
and concubines ; and even the clemency which he shewed, and the
peace which he strove to preserve, must be imputed to the softness
and indolence of his character. Did he subdue his prejudices‚
and those of his subjeets? His mind was tinged with the r'nost puerile
superstition; the influence of the clergy, and the errors of the people,
were consecrated by his laws3 and the oracles of Leo, which reveal,
in prophetie style, the fates of the empire, are founded on the arts
of astrology and divination. Is we still enquire the reason of his
sage appellation‚ it can only be replied, that the son of Bam was

less ignorant than the greater part of his contemporaries in church
