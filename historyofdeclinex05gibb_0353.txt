OF THE ROMAN EMPIR'E.

search will justify a more reasonable estimare. The three hundred
millions, created by the error of a scribe, are reduced to the decent
revenue of four millions three hundred thousand pieces of gold, of
which nine hundred thousand were consumed by the pay of the
soldiers ¹³⁵. Two authentic lists, of the present and of the twelfth
century, are circumscribed within the respechble number of two
thousand seven hundred villages and towns ¹⁵⁶. After a long refidence
at Cairo, a French consul hae ventured to affign about four millions
of Nlahometans, Christians, and Jews, for the ample, thotigh not

incredible, scope, of the population of Egypt ¹³⁷.
IV. The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic

ocean ¹³³, was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman.

some peevish cavils, M. Pauw (Recherches
sur les Egyptien5‚ tom. i. p. 118 ⁴ ηπ.) can
only enlatge his reckoning to ²²50 square
leagues.

p. 334. who calls the common reading or
verfion of Elmacir„ error librarii. His own
emendation, of 4,300,000 pieces, in the im
century‚maintains a probable medium between
the 3,000‚000 which the Arabs acquired by
the conquest ongypt (idem, p. 168.),and the
2,400,000 which the sultan of ConstantInople
levied in the last century (Pietro della Valle,
tom. i. p. 35z.; Thevenot, part i. p. 824.).
Pauw (Recherches, tom. ii. p. 365—373.)
gradually raises the revenue os the Pharaohs,
the Ptolemies, and ihe Caesars‚ from six to
fifteen millions of German crowns.

¹³⁶ The list of Schultens (Index Geograph.
ad calcem Vit. Saladin. p. ς.) contains
2396 places3 that of d’Anville (Mem. sur
l'Egypte‚ p. 29.), from the divan of Cairo,

¹³⁷ See Maillet (Description de l’Egypte‚
p. 28.), who seems to argue with candour
andjudgment. I am much better satisfied
with the observ:.tions than with the reading
of the French consul. He was ignorant cf

Greek and Latin literature, and his fancy is
too much delighted with the fiffions of the
Arabs. Their best knowledge is collec‘ted
by Abulfeda (Descripr. .AEgypt. Arab. et Lat.
ῖι Joh. David Michaelis, Gottingae, in 4‘0,
1770): and in two recent voyages into
Egypt, we are amused by Savary, and in-
struc'ted by Volney. 1 wisst the latter could

travel over the globe.
¹³3 My conquest of Africa is drawn from
two French interpreters of Arabic literature,
Cardonue (Hist. de l'Afrique et de l'Espagne
sous la Domination des Arabes, tom. i. p. 8
—35.) and Otter (Hist. de l'Academie des
Inscriptions, tom. xxi. p. ιιι-ης. and
13³ .). They derive their principal informa-
tion from Novairi, who composcd, A. D.
1331, an Encyclopaedia in more than twenty
volumes. The five general parts succeffively
tremos, 1. Phyfics, z. Man, 3. Animazs,
4.Plants,and,5.History; and the African affairs
are discuffed in the νιῑῙἱ chapter of the „rh scc-
tion of this last part (Reissze, Prodidagmffzta
ad Hagji Chalisae Tabulas, p. 232—234.).
Among the older historians who are quoted
by Novairi we may dissinguistr the original
narrative of a soldier who led the van of the

Mossems. ·
