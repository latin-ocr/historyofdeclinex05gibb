ῳ THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HLA P. hundred and thirteen Mossems, of whom seventy-seven were fu-

·——r--J gitives, and the rest auxiliaries: they mounted by turns a train of
seventy camele (the camels of Yathreb were formidable in war);
but such was the poverty of his first disciples, that only two could

appear on horseback in the field ¹²³. In the fertile and famous vale

of Beder¹²⁹‚ three stations from Medina, he was informed by
his scouts of the caravan that approached on one fide3 of the

Koreish, one hundred horse, eight hundred and fifty foot, who ad-

vanced on the other. After a ssiort debate, he sacrificed the prospe&

of wealth to the pursuit of glory and revenge3 and a ssight intrench-
ment was formed, to cover his troops, and a stream of fresh water that

ἓξὲξ of glided through the valley. “ O G0d‚’' hc exclaimed as the numbers
A.D.’6z3. of the Koreish descended from the hills, “ O God, if these are de-

“ stroyed, by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth ?—Cou-
“ rage, my children, close your ranks ; discharge your arrows, and
“ the day is your own.'' At these words he placed himself, with
Abubeker, on a throne or pulpit ¹³⁰, and instantly demanded the suc-

cour of Gabriel and three thousand angels. His eye was fixed on

¹²¹³ Al Jannabi (apud Gagnier, tom. ii.

,p.9.) allows him seventy or eighty horse;

and on two other occasions prior rothe battle
of Ohud‚ he enlists a body of thirty (p. 10.),
andos 500 (p. 66.) troopers. Yet the Musul-
mans, in the field of Ohud, had no more
than two hon-ses, according to the better sense
of Abulseda (in Vit. Mohamm. ρ, xxxi.
p.65.). In the stany province, the camels
were nuntcrous; but the horse appears to
have been less common than in the Hafpy or
the Dcy'ert A rabia.

high road of the caravan of Egypt; and the

during the aetion is styled by Gagnier (in
Abulfeda, c. ²7· p. 58. vie de Mahomet,
torn. ii. p. 30. 330), Umbraculum, une loge de
bois avec une porte. The same Arabic word
is rendered by Reiske (Annales Mossemici
Abulsedae, p. ²3·) by Solium, Suggestus ca‘i-
ti0r3 and the difference is of the utmost rno-
ment for the honour both os the interpreter
and of the hero. Ι am sorry to observe the
pride and acrimony with which Reiske chas-
tiscs his seno-,v-labourer. Smpe fic vertit, ut
