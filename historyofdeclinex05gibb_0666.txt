profeffed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk ; yet the father of
that race appears to have been a chief of power and renown ¹⁷.
For a daring intrufion into the haram of his prince, Seljuk was
banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his friends and
vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the neighbourhood of
Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and acquired the
crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels. His age, of an

hundred and seven years, surpaffed the life of his son, and Seljuk
adopted the care of his two grandsons, Togrul and Jaafar; the eldest
of whom, at the age of forty-five‚ was invested with the title of
sultan, in the royal city of Nishabur. The blind determination of
chance was justified by the virtues of the successful candidate. It

would be superfluous to praise the valour of a Turk3 and the am-
bition of Togrul ¹⁸ was equal to his valour.
