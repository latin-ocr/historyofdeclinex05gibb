, OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The same princes might affert, with dignity and truth, that of all
the monarchs of Christendom they poffess'ed the greatest city ¹⁴, the
most ample revenue, the most flourilhing and populous state. With
the decline and fall of the empire, the cities of the WVel't had de-
cayed and fallen3 nor could the ruins of Rome, or the mud walls,
wooden hovels‚ and narrow precinGts, of Paris and London, prepare
the Latin stranger to contemplate the fituation and extent of Constan-
tinople, her stately palaces and churches, and the arts and luxury of
an innumerable people. Her treasures might attraC’c, bnt her virgin

strength had repelled‚ and still promised to repel', the audacioris in«
vafion of the Persian and Bulgafian, the Arab and the Ruffian. The
provinces were less fortunate and impregnable; and few districls,
few cities‚ could be discovered which had not been violated by some
fierce Barbarian, impatient to despoil, because he was hopeless to
poffess. From the age of Justinian thev Eastern empire was finking
below its former level z the powers of destruction were more active
than those of improvement3 and the calamities of war were em-
bittered by the more permanent evils of civil and ecclefiastical
tyranny. The captive who had escapcd from the Barbarians was
often stripped and imprisoned by the ministers of his sovereign z the
Greek superstition relaxed the mind by prayer, and emaciated the
body by fasting ; and the multitude of convents and festivals divertcd
many hands and many days from the temporal service of mankind.
Yet the subjects of the Byzantine empire were still the most dextrous
and diligent of nations; their country was blcffed by nature with
every advantage of soil, climate, and fittxation3 and, in the support
and restoration of the arts, their patient and peaceful temper was
more useful than the warlike spirit and feudal anarchy of Europe.
