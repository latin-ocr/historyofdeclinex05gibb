THE DECLINE AND FALL

After the converfion of Hungary, the pil«

h-—v—-J grims who visited Jerusalem might sasely follow the course of the

Danube: in their journey and return they paffed through Philippo-
polis3 and the sexstarieQ disguising their name and heresy, might
accompany the French or German caravans to their respefiive coun-
tries. The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of
t'ne Adriatic, and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to fo-
reigners of every elimate and religion. Under the Byzantine stand-
ard, the Paulicians were often transported to the Greek provinces
of Italy and Sicily; in peace and war they freely conversed with
strangers and nafives, and their opinions were filently propagated in
Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms beyond the Alps ²⁵. It was soon
discovered, that many thousand Catholics of every rank, and of either
sex, had embraced the Manichaean heresy3 and the flames which

eonsumed twelve canons of Orleans, was the first a& and signal of

persecution. The Bulgarians² , a name so innocent in its origin, so

odious in its application, spread their branches over the face of
Europe. United in common hatred of idolatry and Rome, they
were connected by a form of episcopal and preibyterian government3
their various sedis were discriminated by some fainter or darker

shades of theology3 but they generally agreed in the two principles,
the contempt of the old testament, and the denial of the body of

Italy and Franoe, is amply discuss'ed by Mu-
ratori (Antiquitat. Italiae medii AEvi, tom. v.
differt.lx. p. 8¹-¹5²·)› and Mosheim (p. 379
——382. 419—422.). Yet both have over-
looked a curious passage of William the Ap-
pulian, who clearly describes them in a battle
between the Greeks and Normans, Α. D.
‘¹040 (in Muratori, Script. Rerum Ital. tom. ν.
, . 256.).

make thern a kind of Sabellians or Patri-
passians.

²⁹ Bulgccri, Boulgres‚ Bougres, a national
appellation, has been applied by the French
as a term of reproach to usurers and unna-
tural smners. The Patami, or Patelini, has
been made to fignify a smooth and flattering
hypocrite, such as l’Avocat Patelin of that
original and pleasant farce (Ducange‚ Glofl'.
Latinitat. medii et infimi AEvi). The Mani-
chaeans were likewise named Cathari, or the
pure, by corruption, Gazari, &c.
