mands3 and if any feelings ofhumanity were left, he was reduced, with c--v—...e

the return of sense, to approve the salutary disobedience of his servants.
But the most extraordinary feature in the character of Michael, is
the profane mockery of the religion of his country. The supersti-
tion of the Greeks might indeed excite the smile of a philosopher:
but his smile would have been rational and temperate, and he must
have condemned the ignorant folly of a youth who insulted the
objefizs of public veneration. A buffoon of the court was in·-

among whom the emperor was marked, affumed their ecclefiastical
garments: they used or abused the sacred vessels of the altar3 and
in their bacchanalian feasts, the holy communion was administered
in a nauseous compound of vinegar and mustard. Nor were these
impious spectacles concealed from the eyes of the city. On the day
of a solemn festival, the emperor, with his bishops or buffoons, rode
on affes through the streets, encountered the true patriarch at the
head of his clergy; and by their licentious lhouts and obscene ges-
tures, disordered the gravity of the Christian procession. The devo-
tion of Michael appeared only in some offence to reason or piety:
he received his theatrical crowns from the statue of the Virgin3 and
an imperial romb was violated for the sake of burning the bones of
Constantine the Iconoclast. By this extravagant conduct, the son
of Theophilus became as contemptible as he was odious: every
citizen was impatient for the deliverance of his country3 and even
the favourites of the moment were apprehenfive that a caprice might
snatch away what a caprice had bestowed. In the thirtieth year of
his age, and in the hour of intoxication and ssecp, Michael the third
was murdered in his chamber by the founder of a new dynasty,
whom the emperor had raised to an equality of rank and power.
