ι-..ν--ι which I have so patiently copied, a part is refutcd by its own absur-

dity3 and in the private anecdotes of tlte life of princes, the lie is
more easy as the detection is more difficult. Wi‘thout adopting the
pernicious maxim, that where much is alleged, something mull be
true, Ican however discern, that Constantine the fifth was diffo-
lute and cruel. Calumny is more prone to exaggerate than to invent3
and her licentious tongue is checked in some measure by the expe-
rience of the age and country to which she appeals. Of the bissiops
and monks, the generals and magistrates, who are said to have suf-
fered under his reign, the numbers are recorded, the names were
conspicuous, the execution was public, the mutilation vifible and per-
manent. The Catholics hated the person and government of Copro-
nymus; but even their hatred is a proof of their oppression. They

*diffemble the provocations which might excuse or justify his rigour,

but even these provocations must gradually inflame his resentment,
and harden his temper in the use or the abuse of despotism. Yet
the chameler of the fifth Constantine was not devoid of merit, nor
did his government always deserve the curses or the contempt of the
Greeks. From the confeffion of his enemies, Ι arn informed of tlte

oessoration of an ancient aqueduct, of the redemption of two thou-
sand five hundred captive8‚ of the uncomrnon plenty of the times,
and of the new colonies with which he repeopled Constantinople and
the Thracian cities. They reluctantly praise his activity and courage;
he was on horseback in the field at the head of his legions3 and,
although the fortune of his arms was various, he triumphed by sea
and land, on the Euphrates and the Danube, in civil and Barbarian
war. Heretical praise must be cast into the scale, to counterbalance
the weight of orthodox invective. The Iconoclasts revered the vir-
tues of the prince: forty years after his death, they still prayed be-
sore the tomb of the saint. A miraculous vifion was propagated by
