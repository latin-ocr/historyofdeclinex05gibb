330 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΗΜΛ 1‘. The pious delign was approved by the companions of Mahomet and
a--sqs the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from
Medina, with the gifts and the bleffing of the commander of the
faithful. They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty
thousand of their countrymen; and the conduct of the war was en-

caliph‚ who had lately supplanted the conqueror and lieutenant of
Egypt. Yet the favour of the prince, and the merit of his favour-

ignorance, of the apostle. After the conquest of Mecca, he fell
prostrate at the feet of Mahomet: his tears, and the entreaties of
Othman, extorted a reluctant pard0n3 but the prophet declared that
he had so long hefitated, to allow time for some zealous disciple to
avenge his injury in the blood of the apostate. With apparent fide-
lity and effective merit, he served the religion which it was no
longer his interest to desert: his birth and talents gave him an ho-
nourable rank among the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry,
Abdallah was renowned as the boldest and most dextrous horseman
of Arabia. At the head of forty thousand Mollem, he advanced
>from Egypt into the unknown countries of the west. The sands .
of Barca might be impervious to a Roman legi0n3 but the Arabs
were attended by their faithful carnels3 and the nativos of the de-
sert beheld without terror the familiar aspe& of the soil and climate.

After a painful march, they pitched their tents before the walls of
