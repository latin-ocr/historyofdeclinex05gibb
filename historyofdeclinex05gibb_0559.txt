and well-fortified platform3 and the majesty of the purple was k--v--d

emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian. “ Are you a Christian,’'
said the humble Romanus; “ it is your duty to abstain from the
“ blood of your fellow-Christians. Has the thirst of riches seduced
“ you from the bleffings of peace. Sheath your sword, open your
“ hand, and Ι will satiate the utmost measure of your defires.''
The reconciliation was scaled by a domestic alliance3 the freedom
of trade was granted or restored; the first honours of the court
were securcd to the friends of Eulgaria, above the ambafl'adors of

enemies or strangers ¹⁶3 and her princes were dignified with the high A.D. 930»

and invidious title of Bcfileus‚ or emperor. But this friendssiip was
soon disturbed: after the death of Simeon the nations were again
in arms3 his feeble succeffors were divided and extinguished; and,
in the beginning of the eleventh century, the second Basil, who was
born in the purple, deserved the appellation of conqueror of the
Bulgarians. His avarice was in some measure gratified by a treasure
of four hundred thousand pounds sterling (ten thousand pound
weight of gold), which he found in the palace of Lychnidus. His
cruelty inflieoed a cool and exquisite vengeance on fifteen thousand
captives who had been guilty of the defence of their country. They
were deprived of sight, but to one of each hundred a single eye
was left, that he might conduCt his blind century to the presence of
their king. Their king is said to have expired of grief and horror3
the nation was avved by this terrible example3 the Bulgarians were
swept away from their settlements‚ and circumscribed within a nar-
row province 3 the surviving chiefs bequeathed to their children the
advice of patience and the duty of revenge.
