of Europe, the right of peace and war is now confined to a small,
and the actual exercise to a much finaller‚ list of respectable poten-
tates; but each Arab, with impunity and renown, might point his
javelin against the life of his countryman. The union of the nation
confisted only in a vague resemblance of language and manners3 and
in each community, the jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and
itnpotent. Of the time of ignorance which preceded Mahomet‚
seventeen hundred battles ³⁶ are recorded by tradition z hostility was
embittered with the rancour of civil faction ; and the rechal, in prosc
or verse, of an obsolete feud was sufficient to rekindle the same pas-
fions among the descendents of the hostile tribes. In private life,
every man, at least every family, was the judge and avenger of its
own cause. The nice senfibility of honour, which weighs the insult
rather than the injury, ffledS-its deadly venoni on the quarrels of
the Arabs: the honour of their women, and of their beards, is most

expiated only by the blood of the offender ; and such is their patient
inveteracy‚ that they expe& whole months and years the opportunity
of revenge. A fine or compensation for murder is familiar to the
Barbarians of every age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are
at liberty to accept the atonement‚ or to exercise with their own hands
the law of retaliation. The refined mallee of the Arabs refuses even
the head of the murderer, substitutes an innocent to the guilty per-
son, and transfers the penalty to the best and most confiderable of
the race by whom they have been injured. If he falls by their
hands5 they are exposed in their turn to the danger of repristrls, the
