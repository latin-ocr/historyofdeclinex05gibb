OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 551

The consanguinity of the Hungarians and Laplanders would display z-v-—a
the powerful energy of climate on the children of a common pa-

rent ; the lively contrast between the bold adventurers‚ who are in-

toxicated with the wines of the Danube, and the wretched fugitives

who are immersed beneath the snows of the polar circle. Arms and
freedom have ever been the ruling, though too often the unsuecessful,
passion of the Hungarians, who are endowed by nature with a vi-
gorous constitution of soul and body ²⁷. Extreme cold has dimi-
nished the stature and congealed the faculties of the Laplanders; and
the Aretie tribes, alone among the sons of men, are ignorant of
war, and unconseious of human blood: an happy ignorance, if rea-

son and virtue were the guardians of their peace²³l

It is the observation of the Imperial author of the Taciics ²⁹, that ἷξῃᾶἐξίξὲξ
all the Scythiam hords resembled each other in their pastoral and ξξξηὲἒέἕᾶ·
military life, that they all pra-Elised the same means of subsrstence, {figariagj’
'and employed the same instrumeuts of destruction. But he adds, θεὲ. ’ Q μ’

that the two nations' of Bulgarians and Hungarians were superior to
their brethren, and fimilar to each other, in the improvements, how-
ever rude, of their discipline and government ; their visible likeness

²⁵ The eight tribes of the Fennic race,
are described in the curious work of M. Le-
veque(Hist. des Peuples soumis a la Domina-
tion dela Ruffie, tom.i p. 361—561.).

²⁷ This picture of the Hungarians and
Bulgarians is chiefly drawn from the Taclics
of Leo, p. 795—801. and the Latin Annals
which are alleged by Baronius, Pagi, and
Muratori, A.D. 839, &a

in 12⁰¹& Gussavus Adolplms attempted,
without success, to form a regimem of Lap-
landers. Grotius says of these Arftic tribes,
arma arcus et pharetra sed adverfus feras
(Annal. 1.iv. p. ²36), and ειῐῑεηιρῖς, after
the manner of Tacitus, to varnish with

philosophy their bruta] ignorance„

²9 Leo has observed, that the governrnent
of the Turks was monarchical‚ and that theh-
punilhments were rigorous (Tae-ic. pv 896.
Rhegino (in Chron.
A. D. 889) mentions theft as a capital
crime, and his jurisprudence is confirmed by
the original codeofSt.Ste-phen (A.D.1015).
If a ssave were guilty, he was chastised‚ for
the first time, with the loss of his nofe, or a
fine os five heifers ¹, for the second, with the
loss of his ears, or a fimilar fine; for the
third, with death; which the freeman did
not incur till the fourth offence, as his first
penalty was the loss ofliberty (lintona, Hist.
Regum Hungar. torn. i. p. 23¹› 232.).
