THE DECLINE AND FALL

The aged caliph was

‘owe-„2 defirous of poss'essing his dominions, and ending his days in tran-

quillity and repose: while the Moors and Indians trembled at his
name, his palace and city of Damascus was insulted by the Mar-
daites, or Maronites, of mount bibamus, t‘he firmest barrier of the
empire‚ till they were disarmed and transplanted by the suspicions
policy of the Greeks ⁶. After the revolt of? Arabia and Perfia, the
house of Ommiyah⁷ was reduced to the kingdoms of Syria and
Egypt: their distress and fear enforeed their compliance with the
preffing demands of the Christian53 and the tribute was encreased
to a ssave, an horse, and a thousand pieces of gold, for each of the
three hundred and fixty-five days of the solar year. But as soon as»
the empire was again united by the arms and policy of Abdalrnalek‚
he disclaimed a badge of servitude not less injurious to his conscience
than to his pride : he discontinued the payment of the tribute ; and
the resentment of the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad
tyranny of the second Justinian, the just rebellion of his subje&8‚ and
the frequent change of his antagonists and succeffors. Till the reign
of Abdssumlek, the Saracens had been content With the free poffes-
sion of the Persian and Roman treasures, in the coin of chosroes<
and Caesar. By the command of that Caliph, a national mint was
established, both for filver and gold, and the inscription of the Dinar,
though it might be censured by some timorous casuists, proclaimed

⁵ Theophanes, though a Greek, deserves

credit for these tributes (Chronograph. p. 295,
296. 300, 301.). which are confirmed, with

bridgement of the Patriarch Nicephorus,

some variatinn, by the Arabic history ofAbul-
pharagius (Dynast. p. 128. vers. Pocock).

⁶ The censure of Theophanes is just and
pointed, 'rm Ρωμαικην Saarna:
πανδεινα nana πέπονθεν η Ιὶωμωια ziz-o ‘rm Αριβων
μεχρι τε νυν (Chronogxaph. p. 302, 303.).
The series of these events may be traced in
the Annals of Theophanes, and ·in the A·

in a clear and natural style, in the second
volume of Ockley’s History of the Saracens,
p. 253-370. Belides our printed authors,
he draws his materials from the Arabic MSS„
of Oxford, which he would have more deeply
searched, had he been confined to the Bod-
leian library instead of the city jail; a fate
how unworthy of the man and of his country!
