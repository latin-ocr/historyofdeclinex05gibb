his succeffors and subjeers were regardless of his paternal cares, we
may inherit and enjoy the everlasting legacy.

A closer survey will indeed reduce the value of the gift, and the
gratitude of posterity: in the poffession of these Imperial treasures,
we may still deplore our poverty and ignorance3 and the fading
glories of their authors will be obliterated by indifference or con-
tempt. The Bafilics will smk to a broken copy, a partial and muti-
lated version in the Greek language, of the laws of Justinian ; but the
sense of the old civilians is often superseded by the influence of bigotry:
and the absolute prohibition of divorce‚ concubinage, and interest for
money, enssaves the freedom of trade and the happiness os private life.
In the historical book, a subje& of Constantine might admire the ini-
mitable virtues of Greece and Rome ε he might learn to what a pitch
of energy and elevatior] the human characier had formerly aspired.
But a contrary effe& must have been produced by a new edition of
the lives of the saints, which the great logothete or chancellor of the
empire was direeied to prepare: and the dark fund of superstition
was enriehed by the fabulous ancl florid legende of Simon the Me·-
taphmstss. The merits and miracles of the whole calendar are of
less account in the eyes of a fage than the toil of a fingle husband-
man, who multiplies the gifts of the Creator and supplies the food of
his brethren. Yet the royal authors of the Geoponics were more
