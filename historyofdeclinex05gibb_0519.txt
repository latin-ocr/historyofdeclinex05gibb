weighty defests. The decay of their naval power, left the Greeks
and Saracens in pofl'ession of the sea, for every purpose of annoy-
ance and supply. In the age which preceded the institution of
knighthood‚ the Franks were rude and unskilful in the service of
cavalry ⁹¹3 and, iu all perilous emergencies, their warriors were so
conscious of their ignorance, that they chose to dismount from their
horses and fight on foot. Uiipraetised in the use of pikes, or of
missile weaponS, they were eneumbered by the length of their swords,
the weight of their armour, the magnitude of their ssiields, and, if
Ι may repeat the satire of the meagre Greeks, by their unwieldy in-
temperance. Their independent spirit disdained the yoke of subor-
dination, and abandoned the standard of their chief, if he attempted
to keep the field beyond the term of their> stipulation or service. On
all sides they were open to the snares of an enemy, less brave, but
more artful, than themselves. They might 'be bribed‚ for the Bar-
barians were venal ; or surprised in the night, for they neglected the
precautions of a close encampment or vigilant centinels. The fa-
tigues of a summer's campaign exhausted their strength and pa-
tience, and they sunk in despair if their voracious appetite was dis-
appointed of a plentiful supply of wine and of food. This general
chara&er of the Franks was marked with some national and local
ssiades, which Ι should ascribe to accident, rather than to climate,
but which were visible both to natives and to foreigners. An am-
