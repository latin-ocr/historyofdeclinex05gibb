“ blood of your Christian subjecta* Manuel Comnenus was twice
married, to the virtuous Bertha or Irene of Germany, and to-the
beauteous Maria, a French ὸι· Latin princess of Antioch. The only
daughter of his first wife was destined for Bela an Hungarian prince,‘
who was educated at Constantinople under the name of Alexius:
and the consummation of their nuptials might have transferred the
Roman sceptre to a race of frec and warlike Barbarians. But as soon
as Maria of Antioch had given a so'n a'nd 'heir to ,the empire, the
presumptive rights of Bela w'ere abolissied, and he was deprived of his
promised bride3 but the Hungarian prince resumed his name and the
kingdom of his fathers, and displayed such virtues as might excite the
regret and envy of the Greeks. The son of ¹Maria was named Alexius;
and at the age of ten years, he· ascended tlie3Byzantinc throne, after
his father’s decease had closed the glories of the Comnenian line.
The fraternal concord of the two sons of the great Alexius, had

⁰¹ been sometimes clouded by an oppofition of interest and pasfion. By

ambition, Isaac the Sebastocrator was excited to flight and rebellion,
from whence he was rleclairned by the firmness and clemency of John
the Handsome. The errors of Isaac, the father of the emperors of
Trebizond, were short and venial; but John, the elder of his sons,
renounced for ever his religion. Provoked by a real or imaginary
insuit of his uncle, he escaped from the Roman to the Turkish camp ε
his apostacy was rewarded with the Sultan's daughter, the title of
Chelebi, or noble, and the inheritance of a princely estate3 and
the fifteenth century, Mahomet thc second boasted of his Im-
perial descent from the Comnenian family. Andronicus, younger
brother of John, son of Isaac, and grandson of Alexius Comnenus,
is one of the most conspicuous characters of the age3 and his

genuine adventures might form the subjeci of a very singular ro-
mance.
