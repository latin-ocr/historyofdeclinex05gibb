THE DECLINE AND FALL

spouse. The second wife of the emperor Romanus was a maiden
of plebeiam, but of Roman, birth3 and their two daughters, Theo-
phano and Anne, were given in marriage to the princes of the
earth, The eldest was bestowed, as the pledge of peace, on the
eldest son of the great Otho, who had solicited this alliance with
arms and embassies. It might legally be questioned how far a Saxon

>was entitled to the privilege of the French nation: but every scruple

was silenced by the fame and piety of a hero who had restored the
empire of the West. After the death of her father-in-law and
husband, Theophano governed Rome, Italy, and Germany‚ during
the minority of her sou, the third Otho; ancl the Latins have praised
the virtues of an empress, who sacrificed to a superior duty the re-

*membrance of her country ⁶⁴. In the nuptials of her sister Anne,

every prejudice was lost, and every consideration of dignity was su-
perseded, by the stronger argument of necessity and fear. A Pagan
of the north, XVolodomir, great prince of Ruffia, aspired to a
daughter of the Roman purple; and his claim was enforced by the
threats of war, the promise of conversion, and the offer of a power-

—ful succour against a domestic rebel. A vielim of her religion and

country, the Greeian princess was torn from the palace of her fa-
thers, and condemned to a savage reign and an hopeless exile on
the banks of the Borysthenes, or in the neighbourhood of the Polar
circle ⁶⁵. Yet the marriage of Anne was fortunate and fruitful : the
daughter of her grandson Jerossaus was recommended by her Impe-
rial descent3 and the king of France, Henry I. fought a wife on
the last borders of Europe and Christendom⁶⁶.
