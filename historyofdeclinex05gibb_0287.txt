OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

{ketches of a more recent age ¹³. The art and genius of history

have ever been unknown to the Astatics ¹⁴3 they are ignorant of the
laws of criticism3 and our monkish chronicles of the same period
may be compared to their most popular works, which are never vi·
vified by the spirit of philosophy and freedom. The Orieulal library
ofa Frenchman ¹⁵ would instruet the most learned mufti of the East 3
and perhaps the Arabs might not find in a single historiari, so clear
and comprehensive a'narrative of their own exploits‚ as that which
will be deduced in the ensuing sheets.

Ι. In the first year of the first caliph‚ his lieutenant Caled, the
sword of God, and the scourge of the infidels, advanced to the banks
of the Euphrates, and reduced the cities of Anbar and Hira. West-
ward of the ruins of Babylon, a tribe of sedentary Arabs had fixed

themselves on the verge of the desert3 and Hira was the seat of a

¹³ The particular historians and geographer-s
will be occafionally introduced. The four
following titles represent the annals, which
have guided me in ‹his general narrative.
1. Annales Eutychii, Patriarchae Alexandrini,
ab Ed—wardo Pacockio, Oxon, 1636, 2 vols. in
4³⁰. A pompous edition of an indifferent
author, transsated by Pocock ro gratify the
presbyterian prejudices of his friend Sel-
den. 2. Historia Saracenica Georgii Elma-
τίπτ’, operd et studio Thomae Erpenii, in 4³⁰,
Lugd. Batavorum, 1625. He is said to have
hastily transsated a corrupt Ms. and his ver-
fion is often deficient in style and sense.
3. Historia compendiqsa Dynastiarum a Grego-
rio Abulpharagio, interprete lid-wardo Puockio,
in4¹⁰‚ oxon, 1663. More useful sor the
literary than the civil history of the East.
4. Abulsedae Annales Messemici ad Ann. Hegirae,
ccccvi. a Jo. Jac. Restm, in 4¹⁰, Lipfiae, ¹754-
The best of our Chronicles, both for the ori-
ginal and verfion, yet how far below the
name of Abulfeda. We know that he wrote

at Hamah, in the xix-‘¹¹ century. The three
former were Christians of the κώ, xii‘h, and
xffitn centuries ; the two first, natives of
Egypt, a Melchite patriarch, and a Jacobite
scribe.

¹⁴ M. de Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i.
pref. p. xix, xx.) has characterised, with truth
and knowledge, the two sorts of Arabian
historians, the dry annalist, and the tumid.
and flowery orator.

¹⁵ Bibliotheque Orientale, par M. d'Here
belot, in solio, Paris, 1697. For the cha—
raeter cf the respectable author, consult his
friend Thevenot (Voyages du Levant, parti,
ch. 1.). His work is an agreeable miscellany‚
which must gratify every taste; but Ι never
can digest the alphabetical order, and I find
him more satisfactory in therPerfian than the
Arabic history. The recent supplement from
the papers of M. M. Visdelou and Galland
(in folio, La Haye, 1779) is of a different
cast, a medley of tales, proverbs‚ and Chi-
nese antiquities.
