and necessity of his own revelation. In the idiom of the Koran'⁰

the belief of God is inseparable from that of Mahomet: the good
works are those which he has enjoined3 and the two qualifications
imply the profeffion of Illam, to which all nations and all seecs are
equally invited. Their spiritual blindness, though excused by ig-
norance and crowned with virtue, will be scourged with everlasting
torments3 and the tears which Mahomet {hed over the tornb of his
mother, for whom he was forbidden to pray, display a striking con-
trast of humanity and enthusiasm ¹⁰⁹. The doom of the infidele is
common: the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined
by the degree of evidence which they have rejecied, by the magni-

fions of the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the Magiam, and the
idolaters, are sunl< below each other in the abyss; and the lowest
hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have affumed the

demned for their opinions, the true believers only will be judged by
their actions. The good and evil of each Musulman will be ac-
curately weighed in a real or allegorical balance, and a singular mode
of compensation will be allowed for the payment of injuries: the
aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good actions, for the
benefit of the person whom he has wronged; and if he should be
destitute of any moral property, the weight of his sms will be loaded
with an adequate {hare of the demerits of the sufferer. According
