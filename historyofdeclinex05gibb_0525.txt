or captain of the guards, Photius was sent ambassador to the caliph
of Bagdad¹“⁸. The tedious hours of exile, perhaps of confinement‚
were beguiled by the hasty composition of his Library‚ a living mo-

writers, historians, orators, philosophers, theologians, are reviewed
” without any regular method: he abridges their narrative or floctrine,

appreciates their style and character, and judges even the fathers of
the church with a discreet freedom, which often breaks through the
superstition of the times. The emperor Bafil, who lamented the
defects of his own education, entrusted to the care of Photius his
son and successor Leo the philosopher3 and the reign of that prince
and of his son Constantine Porphyrogenitus forms one of the most
prosperous aeras of the Byzantine literature. By their munifi-

without oppreffing the indolence, of the public. Belides the Bqfilics‚
or code of laws, the arts of husbandry and war, of feeding or
destroying the human species, were propagated with equal diligence3
and the history of Greece and Rome was digested into fifty-three heads
or titles, of which two only (of embaffies‚ and of virtues and vices)
have escaped the injurios of time. ln every station, the reader might
contemplate the image of the past world, apply the less‘on or warn-
