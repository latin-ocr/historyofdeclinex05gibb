to cite two examples of lt. At the issand of St. ‘Martius9
the vessels of his Britannic ma J'esty attacked and took by
for‚ce several veffels which were in the road, under the .
cannon of the fortress‚ where, according to the inviolable
law of nadons, these veffels ought to have found a safe
asylum. The insolences committed by an English armed
veffel, upon the coast of the republic, near the issand of
Goedeoeede, furnilh a second example of these violences.
These insolences were pulhed to such a degree that sev-
eral inhabitants of the issand, who were upon the {hore
where they ought to have thought themselves lheltered
from all insult, were exposed by the fire of this veffel to
the most rminent danger, which they could not avoid, but
by ι tiring into the· interior part of the issand. Unheard
of proeeedings, for which the republic‚ notwithstanding
the strongest aad best founded representations, has not
been able to obtain the smallest satisfaction.

While affairs were thus in a fituation‚ which left to
their high mightineffes‚ no other alternative, but to see
the navigation and the commerce of their subjects upon
which depend the prosperity or the ruin of the republic,
wholly annihilated, or to come to violent measures against
their ancient friend and ally. The magnanimous hearts
of her maJ'esty the empress of Ruflia, engaged her to invite
the republic with equal aflection and humansty, to take
measures the most just, and entirely conformable to the
treaties which subsist between them and the other powerS,

,ο the end, to defend and maintain, conjointly with her '⁹

mperial majesty‚ and the other powers of the north, the
privileges and immunsties, which the law of nations, and
the most solemn treaties a'ffure to the neutral flag. This
invitation could not but be infinitely agreeable to their
high mightineffes‚ confidering that lt offered them a means
of establishing the protect-ion of the commerce of their
iubje&s upon the most solid foundations; and opened a
way to place their independenee ιιι safety from all infrac-
tion‚ without derogating' 1n the least from the alliances
contracte d both with his Britannic majesty, and with the
other bellige etn powers
