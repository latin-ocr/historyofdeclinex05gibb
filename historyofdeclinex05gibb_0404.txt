C ῙῖῘΛ P. Disdaining the confinement of their walls, they gave battle to the

VN Arabs on the plain; but an ainbuseade rising stom the shelter of a
quarry, or a rtlin, chastised their indiscretion and intercepted their
return. The wooden turrets of affanlt were rolled forwards to the
foot of the rampart3 but the defence of lNleritla was obstinate and
long 3 and the castle (ff the marlyrs was a perpetual testimony of-the
loffes of the Mossems. The constancy of the besieged was at length
subdued by famine and despair3 and the prudent viCtor disguised his
impatience under the names of cleniency and esteem. The alterna-
tive of exile or tribute was allowed; the churclies were divided be—
tween the two religions ; and the wealtli of those who had fallen in
the siege, or retired to Gallicin, was confiscated as the reward of the
faithful. In the midway between Mei-ida and Toledo‚ the lieu-
tenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent of the caliph‚ and condiieied
him to the palace of the Gothic kings. Their first interview was
cold and formal: a rigid account was exaGoed of the treasnres of
Spain: the charaeter of Tarik was exposed to suspicion and obloquy3
and the hero was imprisoned, reviled, and ignominioussy seourged
by the hand, or the command, of Musa. Yet so stri& was the dis-
cipline, so pure the zeal, or so tame the spirit, of the primitive Mos-
lems, that, after this public indignity, Tarik could serve and be
trusted in the reduftion of the Tarragonese province. A mosch was
ereeted at Saragoffa, by the liberality of the Koreissi: the port of
Bai-colona was opened to the vessels of Syri1t3 and the Goths were
pursued beyond the Pyrenean mountains into their Gallie province of
Septimania or Languecloc¹⁸⁴. In the ellurch of St. Mary at Car-
