OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

minister was no more. Bafil was the acknowledged sovereign of C H A P.

Constantinople and the provinces of Europe3 but Asm was oppress'ed s--v-—u

bv two veteran generals, Phocas and Sclerus, who, alternately friends
and enenries, subjefts and rebels, maintained their independence, and
laboured to emulate the example of successful usurpation. Against
these domestic enemies‚ the son of Romanus first drew his sword, and
they trembled in the presence of a lawful and high-spirited prince,

a character, in such an age, superstition took a firm and lasting pos-
