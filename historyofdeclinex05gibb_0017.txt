OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

fide, demanded for the royal brothers, the partition or exercise of
sovereignty, and supported their seditious claim by a theological ar-
gument. They were Christiane. (they cried), and orthodox Ca-
tholics ; the fincere votaries of the holy and undivided Trinity. Since
there are three equal persons in heaven, it is reasonable there should
be three equal persons upon earth. The emperor invited these
learned divines to a friendly conference, in which they might pro-
pose their arguments to the senate: they obeycd the summons‚ but

the prospe& of their bodies hanging on the gibbet in the suburb of

Galata, reconciled their companions to the unity of the reign of Con-
stantine. He pardoned his brothers, and their names were still pro-
nounced in the public acclamations: but on the repetition or suspicion
of a sunilar offence, the obnoxious princes were deprived of their
titles and noses, in the presence of the Catholic bilhops who were
affembled at Constantinople in the fixth general synod. In the close
of his life, Pogonatus was anxious only to establish the right of pri-
mogeniture : the hair of his two sons, Justinian and Heraclius, was
offered on the shrine of St. Peter, as a symbol of their spiritual
adoption by the pope3 but the elder was alone exalted to the rank
of Augustus and the affurance of the empire.

world devolved to Justinian ΙΙ. ; and the name of a triumphant law-
giver was distmnoured by the vices of a boy, who imitated his
namesake only in the expensive luxury of building. His paffions
were strong3 his understanding was feeble ; and he was intoxicated
with a foolissi pride, that his birth had given him the command
of millions, of whom the smallest community would not have
chosen him for their local magistrate. His favourite ministers were
two beings the least susceptible of human sympaffiy, an eunuch

and a monk: to the one he abandoned the palace, to the other the
