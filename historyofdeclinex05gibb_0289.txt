temnant of thirty thousand regular troops was swelled in truth, or in

the great king, The Mosserns, whose numbers were reinforced
from twelve to thirty thousand, had pitched their camp in the plains
of Cadelia ²² z and their line, though it consisted of fewer men, could

produce more fhldlc’rs than the unwieldy host of the infidels. I shall
here observe what Ι must often repeat, that the charge of the Arabs
was not like that of the Greeks and Romans, the effort of a firm
