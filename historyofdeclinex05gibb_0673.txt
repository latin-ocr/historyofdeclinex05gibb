OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 661

His patriotism‚ and perhaps his pride, urged him from Constanti-
nople within two months after his acceffi0n3 and the next campaign
he most scandaloussy took the field during the holy festival of Easter.
In the palme, Diogenes was no more than the husband of Eudocia ε
in the camp, he was the emperor of the Romans, and he sustained
that character with feeble resources and invincible courage. By his
spirit and success, the soldiers were taught to ast, the subjeffits to
hope, and the enemies to fear. The Turks had penetrated into the

beart of Phrygia3 but the sultan himself had resigned to his emirs
the prosecution of the War3 and their numerous detaehments were
scattered over Afia in the security of conquest. = Laden with spoil
and careless of discipline, they were separately surprised and defeated
by the Greeks: the adtivity of the emperor seemed to multiply his
presence; and while they heard of his expedition to Antioch‚ the
enemy felt his sword on the hills of Trebizond. In three laborious
campaigns, the Turks were driven beyond the Euphrates: in the
fourth and last, Romanus undertook the deliveranee of Armenia.
The desolation of the land obliged him to transport a supply of two
months provisions; and he marehed forwards to the fiege of Ma-
lazkerd³⁰, an important fortress in the midway between the modern
cities of Arzeroum and Van. His army amounted‚ at the least, to
one hundred thousand men. The troops of Constantinople were
reinforced by the disorderly multitudes of Phrygia and Cappadocia ;
but the real strength was composed of the subjee‘ts and allies of
Europe, the legions of Macedonia, and the squadrons of Bulgariaj.
