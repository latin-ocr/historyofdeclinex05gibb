THE DECLINE AND FALL

harmonious song3 nor was it difficult to persuade them, that a choir
of angels descended each day from heaven to join in the devotion
of the Christians ⁷⁶. But, the converslon of W'olodomir was deter-
mined or hastened by his desire of a Roman bride. At the same
time, and in the city of Cherson, the rites of baptism and marriage
were celebrated by the Christian pontiff : the city he restored to the
emperor Bafil, the brother of his spouse3 „but the brazen gates were
transported, as it is said, to Novogorod, and erected before the first

church as a trophy of his νὶἃοτγ and faith ⁷⁷. At his despotic com-

mand, Peroun, the god of thunder‚ whom he had so long adored,
was dragged through the streete of Kiow3 and twelve st'urdy Bar-
barians battered with clubs, the mishapen image, which was en·-
dignantly cast into the waters of the Borysthenes. The edi& of
Wolodomir had proclaimed, that all who ssiould refuse the rites of
baptism would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince;
and the rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient

⁷⁷ Cherson, or 'Cossum is mentioned by
Herberstein (apud Pagi, tom. iv. p. 56.) as
the place of Wolodomir’s baptism and mar-
riage3 and both the tradition and the gates
are still preserved at Novogorod. Yet an ob-
serving traveller transports the brazen gates
from Magdeburgh in Germany (Coxe’s Tra-

nion. The modern reader must not confound
this old Cherson of the Tauri: or Crimaean
peninsula with a new city of the same name,
which has arisen near the mouth of the Borys-
thenes, and was lately honoured by the me—
morable interview ofthe empress ofRuffia with
the emperor of the West.
