the metropolis of the Christian* world. The gates and ramparts u-IssIL-..s
were guarded by a trembling people3 but the tombs and temples of
St. Peter and St. Paul were left exposed in the suburbs of the Va-
tican and of the Ostian way. Their invifible sanffity had protected
them against the Goths‚ the Vandals, and the Lornbards; but the
Arabs disdained both the gospel and the legend ; and their rapacious

chief3 but the preffing emergency superseded the forms and in-
trigues of an elediion3 and the unanimous choice of pope Leo the
