450 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {HA P. name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been
μῆρ’-..ι withdrawn from the world. His twelve apostles dispersed them-
selves among the Bedoweens, “ a raee of men,” says Abulfeda‚
“ equally devoid of reason and of religion ;” and the success of their
preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution. The
Carmathians were ripe for rebellion‚ since they disclaimed the title

pillaged3 Bagdad was filled with consternation3 and the caliph
trembled behind the veils of his palace. In a daring inroad beyond
the Tigris, Abu Taher advanced to the gates of the capital with no
