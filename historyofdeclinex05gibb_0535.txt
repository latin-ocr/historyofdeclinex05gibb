OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Of the ecclefiastical chain, many links had been broken by the
Paulician reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they reduced
the number of masters, at whose voice profane reason must bow
to mystery and miracle. The early separation of the Gnostics had
preceded the establishment of the Catholic worlhip; ancl against the
gradual innovatione of discipline and doctrine, they were as strongly
guarded by habit and aversion, as by the filenee of St. Paul and the
evangelists. The objects which had been⁴ transformed by the magic
of superstition, appeared to the eyes of the Paulicians in their genuine
and naked colours. An image made without hands, was the com-
mon workmanssiip of a mortal artist, to whose sszill alone the wood
and canvass must be indebted for their merit or value. The mira—
culous relies were an heap of bones and ashes, destitute of life or
virtue, or of any relation, perhaps, with the person to whom they
were ascribed. The true and vivifying cross was a pieee of found
or rotten timber3 the body and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and
a cup of wine, the gifts of nature and the symbols of grace. The
mother of God was degraded from her celestial honours and im-
maculate virginity3 and the saints and angels were no longer soli-
·cited to exercise the laborious office, of mediation in heaven, and
ministry upon earth. ln the practice, 01· at least in the theory of
the sacraments, the I'aulicians were inclined to abolish all vifible ob-
jedts of worship, and the words of the gospel were, in theirjudg-
ment, the baptism and communion of the faithful. They indulged
a convenient latitudo for the interpretation of scripture3 and as often
as they were pressed by the literal sense, they could escape to the
intricate males of figure andallegory. Their utmost diligence must
have been employed to dissolve the connection between the old and
’ thc new testament; since they adored the latter as the oraclcs of

could describe the Manichaean books, tam ont pity, Incendite omnes illas membranas:
