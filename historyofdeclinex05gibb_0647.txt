OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. (335

says the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose C {V} P.

attachment to the Greeks was fortified by the jealous enmity of the ⁸-v—-1
Venetians¹¹⁴. The situation and trade of Ancona‘·‘rendered it an

important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice besieged by
the arms of Frederic3 the Imperial forces were twice repulsed by
the spirit of freedom 3 that spirit was animated by the* ambaffador of
Constantinople ; and the most intrepid patriot8‚ the most faithful ser-
vants were rewarded by the wealth and honours of the Byzantine
The pride of Manuel disdained and reje&ed a Barbarian
colleague3 his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the
purple from the German usurpers, and of establishing, in the West,
as in the East, his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans. With
this view, he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of
Rome. Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the Greek mo-
narch3 the splendid nuptiale of his niece with Odo Frangipani‚ se-

polis¹¹⁷. During the quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the
third, the pope twice received in the Vatican the ambaffadors of
Constantinople. They flattered his piety by the long-promised union

reum of the emperor3 and the Latin narrative
is confirmed by Cinnamus (1. iv. c. 14.
p. 98.).

¹¹⁵ Muratori mentions the two fieges of
Ancona; the first in 1167, against FredericI.
in person (Annali, tom. x. p⁴ 39, &c.); the
second, in 1173, against his lieutenant

It is of the second stege, that we possess an
original narrative, which he has published in
his great colleffion (tom. vi. p. 921—946.).

¹¹⁶ We derive this anecdote from an ano-
nymous chronicle of Fossa Nova, publifhed
by Muratori (Scn'pt. Ital. tom. vii. p. 874.).

¹¹⁷ The Βασιλειῡν &rpem Of Cinnamus (l. iv.
c. 14. p. 99.), is susceptible of this double
sense. A standard is more Latin, an image
more Greek.
