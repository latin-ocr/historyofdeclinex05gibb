plained in the third of these didaffic collections, which may be
ascribed to Constantine or his father Leo ⁴. In the fourth, of the

administration of the empire, he reveals the secrets of the Byzantine
pohey, in friendly or hostile intercourse with the natione of the

earth. The literary labours of the age, the pi‘aClical systems of law,
agriculture, and history, might redound to the benefic of the sub-
je& and the honour of the Macedonian princes· The fixty books of
the Bcfilics ⁵, the code and pandecte of civil jurisprudence, were gra-
dually framed in the three first reigns of that prosperous dynasty.
‘The art of agriculture had amused the leisure, and exercised the pens,
of the best and wisest of the ancients ; and their chosen precept-s are
comprised in the twenty books of the Geoponics⁶ of Constantine. At
his command, the historical -examples of vice and virtue were me-

thodised in fifty-three books ⁷, and every citizen might apply, to his
contem-

bus, p. 1-—24- de Administrando Imperio,
p. 45—127. edit. Vener. The text of the
old edition of Meurfius is correRed from a
MS. of the royal library of Paris, which Isaac
Casaubon had formerly seen (Epist. ad Poly-
bium, p. ια), and the sense isillustrated by
two maps of William Dessisse, the prince of
geographers, till the appearance ofthe greater
d’Anville.

⁴ The Tafflcs of Leo and Constantine are
published with the aid of some new MSS. in
the greatedirion ofthe works of Meurfius, by
the learned John Lami (rom. vi. p. 531—920.
¹2¹¹-¹4¹7· Florent. 1745)› yet the text is
still corrupt aud mutilated, the version is still
obscure and faulty. The Imperial librar-y
of Vienna would afford {ome valuable rna-
terials to a new editor (Fabric. Bibliot. Graec.
torn. vi. p. 369‚ 370.).

⁵ On the subjec't of the Bast‘lics, Fabricius
(Bibliot. Graec. tom. xii. p. 423--314.)‚
and Heineccius (Hist. Juris Romani, p. 390—-
399.)‚ and Giannone (istoria civile di Napoli,

Voir. V.

tom. i. p. 430-438.), as historical civilians
may be usesully consulted. xm books of
this Greek code have been published‚ with
a Latin version, by Charles Annibal Fabrot-
tus-(Paris, ¹6·l>7)› in seven tomes in foli0;
ιν other books have been {lnce discovered,
and are inserted in Gerard Meerman’s Novus
Thesaurus Juris Civ. et Canon. tom. ν. Of
the whole work, :he fixty books, John Leun-
clavius has printed (Bafil, 1373) an eclogae,
or synopsis. The cx111 novels, or new law-s,
of Leo, may be found in the Corpus Juris
Civilis. .

‘⁵ I have used the last and best edition of
the Geoponics (by Nicolas Niclas, Lipfiae,
¹78¹’ 2 vols. in octavo). I read in the pre-
face, that the same emperor restored rhe
long-forgotten systems os rhetoric and philo-
sophy: and his two books of Hippiam-ica, or
Herse-physic, were publilhed at 1³:112, 1330,
in folio (Fabric. Biblior. Graec. tom. vi.
