OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. ⁷73

mance. To justify the choice of three ladies of royal birth, it is in- C Xflfvfss P.
cumbent on me to observe, that their fortunate lover was cast in the ι-ν--Ι
best proportions of strength and beauty; and that the want of the
softer graces was supplied by a manly countenance‚ a lofty stature,
athletic muscles, and the air and deportment of a soldier. The pre—
servation, in his old age, of health and vigour‚ was the reward of
temperance and exercise. A piece of bread and a draught of water
was often his sole and evening repast; and if he tasted of a wild
boar, or a stag, which he had roasted with his own hands, it was
the well-earned fruit of a laborious chace. Dextrous in armS, he
was ignorant of fear: his persuafive eloquence could bend to every
situation and charadier of life: his style, though not his prac‘tice, was

name of his concubine; and both the palaee and the camp could
witness that she ssept, or watched, in the arms of her lover. She
accompanied him to his military command of Cilicia, the first scene
of his valour and imprudence. He prefl'ed‚ with aftive ardour, the
siege of Mopsuestia: the day was employed in the boldest attack83
'but the night was wasted in song and dance3 and a band of Greek
comedians formed the choicest part of his retinue. Andronicus was
