THE DECLINE AND FALL

The grammar and logie, the
mufic and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated as the hand-
maids of superstiti0n3 but the curiofity of the human mind must
ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of learn-
ing'refleclffi the purest and most pleasmg lustre on the character of
Charlemagne¹⁰³. The dignity of his person ¹⁰⁴, the length of his
reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigour of his government, and
the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him from the royal
crowd; and Europe dates a new aera from his restoration of the
XVestern empire.

That empire was not unworthy of its title ¹⁰⁵3 and some of the
fairest kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or conquest of a
prince, who reigned at the same time in Franee, Spain, Italy, Ger-
many, and Hungary ¹⁰⁶. Ι. The Roman province of Gaul had been
transformed into the name and monarchy of FRANCE ; but, in the

corrected this obvious meaning, and the title
of M. Gaillard’s Differtation (tom. iii. p. 247
—260.) betrays his partiality.

and Schmidt, torn. ii. p. 121—129.

¹⁰⁴ M. Gaillard (tom. iii. p. 372.) fixes
the true stature of Charlemagne (see a Dis-
serrarion of Marquard Freber ad calcem E-
ginhart. p. 220, &c.) at five feet niue inches
of French‚ about fix feet one inch and a
fourth English, measure. The romance
writers have increased it to eight seer, and
the giant was eudowed with marchless
strength and apperire: at ει single stroke cf
