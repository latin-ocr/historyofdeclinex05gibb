OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

In the vacant space between ΡειΓιει, Syria, Egypt, and AEtl1iopia‚C H Α Ρ
the Arabian peninsula² may be conceived as a triangle of spacious L

but iriegular dimenfions.

From the noithern point of Beles³ on

the Euphrates, a line of fifteen hundred miles is terminated by the

streights of Babelrnandel and the land of frankincense.

this length may be allowed for the middle breadth, from east to
west, from Baffora to Suez, from the Perfian Gulf to the Red Sea ⁴.
The fides of the triangle are gradually enlarged‚ and the southern

bafis presents a front of a thousand miles to the Indian ocean.

entire sui-face of the peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that
of Germany or France3 but the far greater part has been justly stig-

matised with the epithets of the stony and the sandy‚

Even the wilds

of Tartary are decked, by the hand of nature, with lofty trees

² The geographers of Arabia may be di-
vided into three classes: 1. The Greeks and
Latins, whose progreffive knowledge may be
traced m Agatharcides (de Mari Rubro, in
Hudson, Geograph. Minor. tom. i.), Diodo-
rus-Siculus (tom. i. l. ii. p. 159—167. 1. iii.
p. 211-216. edit. Weffeling), Strabo (l. xvi.
p. niz—1114. from Eratosthenes, p. 1122
——113z. from Artemidorus), Dionysius (t'e-
riegesis, 927—969.), Pliny (Hist. Natur. v.
12. vi. 32), and Ptolemy (Descript. et Ta-
bulae Urbium, in Hudson, torn.iii.). 2. The
Arabt'c writers, who have treated the subje&
with the zeal of patriotism or devotion : the
extraCKs of Pocock (Specimen Hist. Arabum,
p. 125—128.) from the Geography of the
Sherif al Edriffi, render us still more diffa-
tisfied with the version or abridgment (p. 24
—z7. 44—36. 108, Sec. 119, ἅτ.) which the
Maronites have published under the absurd
title os GeographiaNubiensis (Paris, 1619);
but the Latin and French transsators, Greaves
(in Hudson, torn. iii.) and Galland (Voyage
dela Palaestine par La Roque, p. κός-346),
have opened to us the Arabia of Abulfeda,
the most copious and correft account os the
peninsula, which may be enriched, however,

ville, l'Euphrate et le Tigre, p. 19, 20. It
was in this place, the paradise or garden ofa
satrap, that Xenophon and the Greeks first
passed the Euphrates (Anabasss, l. i. c. 10.
