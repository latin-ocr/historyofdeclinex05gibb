“ be dead, our witness, our intercessor, our mediator, with God? ·

‡“ By God he is not dead3 like Moses aud Jesus he is wrapt in a

The evidence offense was disregartled ; and Omar, unsheathing his

The tumult
was appeased by the weight and moderation of Abubeker. “ Is it

should dare to affirm that the prophet was no more.

“ Mahornet, whom you worship.

“ ing to his own prediffion, he has experienced the common fate

“ of mortality.” He was pioufly interred by the hands of his

nearest kinsman‚ on the same spot on which he expired ¹⁵¹ ; Medina
has been sanctified by the death and burial of Mahomet3 and the
innumerable pilgrims of Mecca often turn afide from the way, to
bow, in voluntary devotion ¹⁵², before the simple tomb of the pro-
phet ¹⁵³.

¹⁵¹ The Greeks and Latinshaveinvented and
propagated the vulgar and ridiculous story, that
Mahomet's iron tomb is suspended in the air
at Mecca (σῆμα μετεωριζημειω. Laonicus Chal-

coeondyles de Rebus Turcicis, l. iii. p. 66.)‚
by the aflion of equal and potent loadstones

tombs of the prophet and his companions;
and the learned casuist decides. that this a&
of devotion is nearest in obligation and merit
to a divine precept. The doctors are divided
which, of Mecca or Medina, be the most ex-

cellent (p. 391—394.).

Mahornet, are described by Abulfeda and
Gagnier (Vit. Moham. p. 133—142. Vie
de Mahomet‚ tom. iii. p. :zo—271.). The
most private and interesting circumstances
were originally received from Ayesha, Ali,
the sons of Abbas, &c.; and as they dwelt at
Medina, and survived the prophet many
years, they might repeat the pious tale to a
second οτ third generation of pilgrims.
