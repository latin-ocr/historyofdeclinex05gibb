first or the last of writers, according to the different estimate of sceptics
or believers. The works of speculation or science may be reduced
to the four claffes of philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and phy-
fic. The fages of Greece were transsated and illustrated in the
Arabic language, and some treatises‚ now lost in the original, have
been recovered in the verfions of the East⁵⁶‚ which poffeffed and
studied the writings of Aristotle and Plato, of Euclid and ApolloniuS,
of Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen ⁵⁷. Among the ideal systems,
which have varied with the fashion of the times, the Arabians
adopted the philosophy of the Stagiritc:‚ alike intelligible or alike
obscure for the readers of every age. Plato wrote for the Athenians‚
and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with the language
and religion of Greece. After the fall of that religion, the Peripa-
tedes, emerging from their obscurity, prevailed in the controverfies of
the Oriental Γεᾶε, and their founder was long afterwards restored by
the Mahometans of Spain to the Latin schools ⁵⁸. The phyfics, both
of the Academy and the Lycaeum, as they are built, not on observa-

Yet the fifth book had been previoussy re-

rstored by the mathematical divination of Vi-

viani (see his eloge in Fontenelle, tom. v.
p. 59, &c ).

freely discuffed by Remudot (Fabric. Bibliot-
Graec. tom.i. p. siz—816), and piously de-
fended by Casiri (Bibliot. Arab. Hispana,
tomi. p. 238—240.). Most of the versions
of Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, Sec.
are ascribed to Honain, a physician cf the
