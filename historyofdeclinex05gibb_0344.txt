340 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΗΜΛ Ρ· of Medina, the eyes of Omar were fixed on the camp and city:

z-qf--ae his voice excited to arms the Arabian tribes and the veterans of
Syria3 and the merit of an holy war was recommended by the pe-
culiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious for the ruin or expui--
fion of their tyrants‚ the faithful natives devoted their labours to the
service of Amrou3 some spark‘s of martial spirit were perhaps rc-
kindled by the example of their allies3 and the sanguine hopes of ’
Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church of St. John of ”
Alexandria. Eutychius the patriarch observes, that the Saracens-
fought with the courage of lions; they repulsed the frequent and'-
almost daily sallies of the besieged, and soon affaulted in their turn.- -
the walls and towers of the city. In every attack, the sword‚ the:
banner of Amrou, glittered in the van of the Mos-lema. On a me·-

morable day, he was betrayed by his imprudent valour: his fol*

 

lowers who had entered the citadel were driven back3 and the ger
neral, with a friend and a'ssave, remained a prisoner inthe hands of
the Christians. XVhen Amrou was condueted before the praefecr, hev
remembered his dignity a-nd forgot his situation ; a lofty demeanour„
aud resolute language, revealed the lieutenant- of the caliph,. and the>
battle-axe of a soldier was already raised to strike off the head of the.-
audacious captive. His life was saved by the readiness of his ssave,.
who instantly gave his master a blow on the face, and commanded
’ him, with an angry tone, to be filent in the presence of his superiore„
The credulous Greek was deceived3 he listened to the offer of a.
treaty‚ and his prisoners were difiniffed in the hope of a more re·-
spectable embaffy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced··1
the return of their general, and insulted the folly of the infidels. Atv
