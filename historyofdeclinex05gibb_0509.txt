und if an hostile people preffed too closely on the frontier, they were
recalled to the defence of their country, and the desire of peace, by
the well-managed attack of a more distant tribe ⁷⁰. The command of
the Mediterranean, from the mouth of the Tanais to the columns of
Hercules, was always claimed, and often poffcffed, by the suc-ceffors
of Constantine. Their capital was filled with naval stores and dex-
trous artificers: the situation of Greece and Asta, the long coasts,
deep gulfs, and numerous issands, accustomed their subjec'ts to the
exercise of navigati0n3 and the trade of Venice and Amalfi supplied
a nursery of seamen to the Imperial fleet⁷¹. Since the time of the
Peloponefian and Punic wars, the sphere of aetion had not been en-
