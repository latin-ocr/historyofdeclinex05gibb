THE DECLINE AND FALL

A P· The servile, or grateful, freedman understood the hint, and yielded

u-v-—J without hefitation to the love of his benefactor. But as the filial re-

lation had excited some doubt and scandal, the angel Gabriel de-
scended from heaven to ratify the deed, to annul the adoption, and
gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence of his
God. One of his wives} Hafna, the daughter of Omar, surpriscd
him on her own bed, in the embraces of his Egyptian captive: she
promised secrecy and forgiveness t he swore that he would renounce
the poffeffion of Mary. Both parties forgot their engagements; and
Gabriel again descended with a chapter of the Koran, to absolve
him from his oath, and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives
and concubines, without listening to the clamours of his wives. In
a solitary retreat of thirty days, he laboured, alone with Mary, to
fulfil the commands of the angel. XVhen his love and revenge were
satiated, he summoned to his presence his eleven wives, reproached
their disobedience and indiscretion, and threatened thern with a sen·
tence of divorce, both in this world and in the next: a dreadful
sentence, fince those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were
for ever excluded from the hope of a second marriage. Perhaps the
incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by <the tradition of his
natural or preter-natural gifts ¹⁶²: he united the manly virtue of thirty
of the children of Adam ; and the apostle might rival the thirteenth
labour ¹⁶³ of the Grecian Hercules ¹⁶⁴. A more serious and decent
