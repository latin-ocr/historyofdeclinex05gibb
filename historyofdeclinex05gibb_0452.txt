the fragments of the Roman forum. The first days of his reign
were consecrated to the purification and removal of relies, to

prayers and proceffi0ns‚ and to all, the solemn offices of religion,

of the multitude. The public defence had been long 11egle6led, not
from the presumption of peace, but from the distress and poverty of
the times. As far as the scantiness of his meam, and the ssiortness of
his leisure would allow, the ancient walls were repaired by the com-
mand of Leo; fifteen towerS, in the most acceffible stations, were
built or renewed;btwo of these commanded on either fide the Tyber ;
and an iton chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent
of an hostile navy. The Romans were affui-ed of a short respite by
the welcome news, that the fiege of Gayeta had been raised, and
