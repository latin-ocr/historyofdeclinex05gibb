against such proceedings, were to no purpose3 and it
was in vain that we demanded, in the strongest manners
the treaty of commerce which subsisted between England
,and the republic. Byssthis trearty the rights and liberties
rof the neutral flag were clearly defined and stated, The
subjects of Great Britain had enjoyed the full advantage
of this treaty in the first and the only case, in which ir
