unseasonable wit displeased the Imperial lover: he turned alide in C H A P.

She deserved the love, but did not escape the severity, of 116110111.
From the palace garden he beheld a vess'el deeply laden, and steering
⁷ into the port: on the discovery that the precious cargo of Syrian
luxury was the property of his wife, he condemned the ship to the
flames, with a sharp reproach, that her avarice had degraded the
charaCter of an empress into that of a merchant. Yet his last choice
entrusted her with the guardianship of the empire and her son Mi-
chael‚ who was left an orphan in the fifth year of his age. The
restoration of inunges, and the final extirpation of the Iconoclasts,

fervour of religious zeal, Theodora entertained a grateful regard for
the memory and salvati'on of her husband. After thirteen years of
a prudent and frugal administratum, 1116 perceived the decline of
her influence3 but the second Irene imitated only the virtues of her
predecessor. Instead of conspiring against the life or government
of her son, she retired, without a struggle, though not without a

the contempt and ingratitude of the headstrong youth. At the age
of eighteen, he rejed'ted her authority, without feeling his own in-
