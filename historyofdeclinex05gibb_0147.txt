OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 143

the repeated treasons of Tafillo justified the abolition of their here· C {Im} ’ἢ
ditary dukes ς and their power was shared among the counts, who μ-ν-ι
judged and guarded that important frontier. But the north of Ger-

mamr, from the Rhine and beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and
Pagan3 nor was it till after a war of thirty-three years that the
Saxons bowed under the yoke of Christ and· of Charlemagne. The
idols and their votaries vvere extirpated: the foundation of eight*
biihoprics, of Munster, Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden‚ of Bre-
men, Verden, Hildesheim, and Halberstadt‚ define, on either fide of
the XVeser,¹ the bounds of ancient Saxony3 these episcopal seats were
the first schools and citics of that savage land ; and the religion and>
humanity of the children atoned, in some degree, for the maffacre
of the parents. Beyond the Elbe, the Shzvi, or Sclavenians, of firni-
lar manners and various denominatione, overspread the modern do-
minions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia‚ and some transient marks
of obedience have tempted the French historian to extend the empire
to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or converfion of those
countries is of a more recent age3 but the first union of Bohemia
withthe Germanic body may be justly ascribed to the arms of
Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the Avare, or Huns of Pan- Hungary„
nonia, the same calamities which they had inflieted on the natione.
Their rings, the wooden fortifications which encircied their districts
and villageS‚ were broken down by the triple effort of a French army,
that was poured into their country by land and water, through the
Carpathian mountains and along the plain of the Danube. After
a bloody confii& of eight years, the loss of some French generals was
avenged by the ssaughter of the most nobie Huns : the relies of the
nation submitted: the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate
and unknown3 and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty
years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches of
Italy*
