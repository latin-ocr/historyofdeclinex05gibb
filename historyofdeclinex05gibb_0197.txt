the altars of Phoenicia and Egypt, of Rome and Carthage, have z--vssa

been polluted with human gore: the cruel praefice was long pre-
served among the Arabs3 in the third century, a boy was annually
sacrificed by the tribe of the Dumatians⁵¹3 and a royal captive was
pioussy ssaughtered by the prince of the Saracens, the ally and sol-
dier of the emperor Justinian ⁵². A parent who drags his son to
the altar, exhibits the most painful and sublime effort of fanaticism :

the deed, or the intention, was sanetified by the example of saints,

and heroes3 and the father of Mahomet himself was devoted by a
rash vow, and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of an hundred
camel& In the time of ignmance, the Arabs, like the Jews and
Egyptians, abstained from the taste of swine's flesh⁵³; they circum-
cised⁵⁴ their children at the age of puberty: the same customs‚ without
the censure or the precept of the Koran, have been filently trans-

mitted to their posterity and proselytes. It has been sagacioussy con-

⁸⁰ The two horrid subjests ofAv3f09vmz and
Παιέιθυσια, are accurately discussed by the
learned Sir John Maribam (Canon. Chron.
p. 76—78. 301—304.). Sanchoniatho derives
the Phoenician sacrifices from the example of
Chronus; but we are ignorant whether Chro-

nus lived before or after Abraham, or indeed
whether he lived at all.

⁵⁸ Κατέτος mua-w παιδα tevai, is the reproach
of Porphyty3 but he likewise imputes to the
Roman the same barbarous custom, which,
A.U. C. 657, had been finally abolished.
Dumaetha, Daumar al Gendal, is noticed by
Ptolemy (Tabul. p. 37. Arabia, p.9.-·—29.)
and Abulfeda (p.37.); and may be found in
d’Anville’s maps, in the mid-desert between
Ch aibat and Tadmor.

⁵² Procopius (de Bell. Persico, l.i. c. 28.)‚
Evagrius (l. vi. e. πμ), and Pocock (Speci-
men, p. 72· 36), attest the human szicrifices
of the Arab: in the vim century. The dan-

ther than a fa& (Gagnier‚ Vie de Mahomet„
tom. i. p. 82—84.).

³¹ Suillis carnibus abstinent, says Solinus
(Polyhistor. c. 33.), who copies Pliny (1. viii.
068.) in the strange suppofition, that hogs
cannot live in Arabia. The Egyptians were
ae'tuated by a natural and superstitious horror
for that unclean beast (Mai-ssiam, Canon.
p. 205.). The old Arabians likewise prac-
tised, post coitum, the rite of ablution (Hero-
dot.1.i. c.80.), which is sanctified by the
Mahometan law (Reland, ρκ’-»5, &c. Char-
din, or rather the Mollah of Shaw Abbas,
tom. iv. p.71‚ &c.).

5‘ The Mahometan dod'tors are not fond of
the subjeft; yet they hold circumcifion neces·
sary to salvation, and even pretend that Ma-
homet was miraculoussy born without a fore-
{kin (Pocock. Specimen, p. 319, 320. Sale's
Preliminary Discourse, p. 106, ¹07¹)-
