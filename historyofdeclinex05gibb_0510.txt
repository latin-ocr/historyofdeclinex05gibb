THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A ¹‘= mones ⁷³, or light gallies of the Byzantine ernpire, were content with

&vav—J two tire of oars ; each tire was composed of five and twenty benches;

and two rowers were seated on each bench, who plyed their oars on
either fide of the vcffel. To these we must add the captain or cen-
turion, who, in time of anion, stood erc& with his armour-bearer
on the poop, two steersmen at the helm, and two officers at the
prow, the one to manage the anchor, the other to point and play
against the enemy the tube of liquid fire. The whole crew, as in
the infancy of the art, performed the double service of mariners and
soldiers; they were provided with defenfive and offenfive arms, with
bows and arrows‚ which they used from the upper deck, with long
pikes, which they pushed through the port holes of the lower tire.
Sometimes indeed the ships of war were of a larges and more solid
construction3 and the labours of combat and navigation were more
regularly divided between seventy soldiers and two hundred and
thirty mariners. But for the most part they were of the light and
manageable fize3 and as the cape of Malea in Peloponesus was still
clothed with its ancient terrors‚ an Imperial fleet was transported
five miles over land across the Isthmus of Corinth ⁷⁴. The principles
of maritime tactim had not undergone any change smee the time of
Thucydides: a squadron of gallies still advanced in a crescent,
charged to the front, alid strove to impel their sharp beaks against
the feeble fides of their antagonists. A machine for casting stones
and dai-ts was built of strong timbers in the midst of the deck3 and

were for real use: the forty rows of Ptolemy to the clame appellation of Triremes. The
