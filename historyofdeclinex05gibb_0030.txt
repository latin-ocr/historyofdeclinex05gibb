26 , THE DECLINE AND FALL

ΟΧῗνῇιΡ· though widely diffused, was faithfully kept above eight months, till
u—v-—Q the emperor, suspicious of his danger, escaped from Constantinople,
with the design of appealing to the provinces and armies. By this
hasty flight, the empress was left on the brink of the precipice3 yet
before ssie implored the mercy of her son, Irene addressed a private
epistle to the friends whom she had placed about his person, with a
menace, that unless they accomplilhed, she would reveal, their trea-
son. Their sear rendered them intrepid3 they seized the emperor
on the Asiatie shore, and he was transported to the porphyry apart-
ment of the palace, where he had first seen the light. In the mind
of Irene, ambition had stifled every sentiment of humanity and na-
ture3 and it was decreed in her bloody council, that Constantine
ihould be rendered incapable of the throne: her emissaries affaulted
the sseeping prince, and stabbed their daggers with such violence and
precipitation into his eyes, as if they meant to execute a mortal
sentence. An ambiguous passage of Theophanes persuaded the an-
nalist of the church that death was the immediate consequence of
this barbarous execution. The Catholics have been deceived or sub-
dued by the authority of Baronius; and protestant zeal has re-
eehoed the words of a cardinal, defirous, as it should seem, to fa·-

vour the patroness of images. Yet the blind son of Irene survived
many years, oppressed by the court and forgotten by the world:
the Isaurian dynasty was silently extinguilhed3 and the memory of
Constantine was recalled only by the nuptials' of his daughter Eu-
phrosyne with the emperor Michacl the second. ’

1 fffff The most bigotted orthodoxy has justly execrated the unnatural
Α’Ῑίζὶῗῇἶζ mother, who may not easily be paralleled in the history of crimes.
D To her bloody deed, superstition has attributed a subsequent dark-
ness of seventeen days3 during which many vefl'els in mid-day were

driven from their course, as if the sun, a globe of fire so vast and

so remote, could sympathise with the atoms of a revolving planet.
