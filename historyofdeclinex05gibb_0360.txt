356 THE DECLINE AND PALL

C fh} Ρ· quity of Tingi, or Tangier, have been decorated by the Greek and

a--o-a Arabian sables3 but the figurative expressions of the latter, that the
walls were construdled of brass, and that the roofs were covered with
gold and lilver, may be interpreted as the emblems of strength and
opulence. The province of Mauritania Tingitana¹⁵⁰, which affumed
the name of the capital, had been imperfeQIy discovered and settled
by the Romans3 the five colonies were confined to a narrow pale,
and the more southern parts were seldom explored except by the
agents of luxury, who searched the forests for ivory and the citron
wood¹⁵¹, and the {hores of the ocean for the purple iheu-fifh. The
fearless Akbah plunged into the heart of the country, traversed the
wilderness in which his succeffors eree‘ced the splendid capitals of Fen
and Morocco ¹⁵², and at length penetrated to the verge of the Atlan-
tic and the great desert. The river Sus descends from the western
fides of mount Atlas, fertilises, like the Nile, the adjacent soil, and
falls into the sea at a moderate distance from the Canary, or Fortu-

'⁵⁰ Regio ignobilis, et vix quicquam il-
lustre sortita, parvis oppidis habitatur, parva
flumina emittit, solo quam viris melior et
segnitie gentis obscura. Pomponius Mela,
5. ς, iii. 10. Mela deserves the more credit,
fince his own Phoenician ancestors had mi—
grated from Tingitana to Spain (see, in ii. 6.
a pass‘age of that geographer so cruelly tor-
tured by Salmasius, Isaac Voffius, and the most
virulent of critics, James Gronovius). He
lived at the time ofthe final reduffion of that
country hythe emperor Claudius: yet almost
thirty years afterwards, Pliny (Hm. Nat.
v. 1.) complains of his authors, too lazy
to enquire, too proud to confess their igno-
rance of that wild and remote province.

prevailed at Rome among the men, as much
as the taste sor pearls among the women. Λ

sand pounds sterling (Plin. Hist. Natur. xiii.
29.). l conceive that 1 must not confound
the tree citrus, with that of the fruit cirrum.
But Ῐ am not botanist enough to define the
former (itis like the wild cypress) by the vul·
gar or Linnaean name; nor will 1 decide
whether the citrum be the orange or the
lernon. Salmafius appears to exhaust the sub·
jeci, but he too osten involves himself in the
web of his disorderly eruditiori (Plinian.
Exercitat. tom.ii. p.666, &c.).

tom. ii. p. 253. This province, the first scene
of the exploits and greatness of the cherfi, is
often mentioned in the curious history of that
dynasty at the end of the iit* volume of
Marmol, Description de l'Afriquc. The iii*
vol. of the Recherches Historiques sur les
Maures (lately published at Paris) illustrares
the history and geography os the kingdoms of
Fez and Morocco.
