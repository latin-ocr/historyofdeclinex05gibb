THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HLA P. leptic fits, an absurd caltunny of the Greeks, would be an objest
Q of pity rather than abhorrence¹⁴⁹3 but he serioussy believed that

‘he was poisoned at Chaibar'by the revengc of a Jewilh female¹⁵⁰.

During four years, the health of the prophet declined ; his infirmi-
ties encreased; but his mortal disease was a fever of fourteen dayS,
which deprived him by intervals of the use of reason. As soon as
he was conscious of his danger, he edilied his brethren by the hu—
mility of his virtue or penitence. ‘⁴ If there be any man‚” said the
apostle from the pulpit‚ “ whom I have unjustly scourged, I submit
‘i‘ my own back to the lash of retaliation. Have I aspersed the
“ reputation of a Musulman? let him proclaim my faults in the face

“ of the congregation. Has any one been despoiled of his goods?

·“ the little thatI possess shall compensate the principal and the interest
“⁴ of the debt.” “ Yes‚'’ replied a voice from the crowd, “ Ι am

“ entitled to three drame of silver.’' Mahomet heard the com-

plaint, satisfied the demand, and thanked 'his creditor for accustng
him in this world rather than at the day of judgment. He beheld
with temperate firmness the approach of death3 enfranchised his
ssaves (seventeen men, as they are named, and eleven women) ; mi-
nutely direcC‘ted the order of his funeral, and moderated the lamenta-

. tions of his weeping friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction

of peace. Till the third day before his death, he regularly performed
the funCtion of public prayer: the choice of Abubeker to supply

¹⁴⁹ The epilepsy, or falling-fickness, of
Mahomet‚ is asserted by Theophanes, Zo-

·naras, and the rest of the Greeks; and is

grecdily swallowed by the gross bigoti-y of
Hotiinger (Hist. Orient. p.10, 1¹.), Pri-
deaux (Life of Mahomet, p. ¹²1). and Ma-
racci (tom. ii.),-A1coran (p. 762, 763.).
The titles (the wrapped-up, the covered) of

two chapters of the Koran (73, 74.), can
hardly be strained to such an interpretation;
the filcnce, the ignorante of the Mahometan

commentators‚ is more conclusive than the
most peremptor-y denial; and the charitable
fide is espoused by Ockley (Uist. of the Sa-
rmens, tom. i. p. 301.), Gagnier (ad Abul-
feda, p. 9. Vie de Mahomet. tom. i. p. 118.),
and saie (Koran. p. 469—474.).
¹⁵⁰ This poison (more ignominious since
it was offered as a test of his prophetie know-
ledge) is srankly confess‘ed by his zealous vo-
taries, Abulfcda (p. 92.), and Al Jannabi
(apud Gaguier, tom.ii. p. 286-288.).
