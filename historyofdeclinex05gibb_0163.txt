OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

swabians, and Bohemians, who usurped the purple and prerogatives

of the Caesars.
There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than

to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nafions, in oppo-
fition to their inclination and interest. A torrent of Barbarians may
pass over the earth, but an extenfive empire must be supported by a
refined system of policy and oppreffion: in the centre, an absolute
power, prompt in aetion, and rich in resources: a swift and easy
communication with the extreme parts: fortifications to check the
first effort of rebellion: a regular administration to prote& and
punish3 and a well-disciplined army to inspire sear, without pro-
voking discontent and despair. Far different was the situation of the
German Caesars, who were ambitious to enssave the kingdom of
Italy. Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine, or
scattered in the provinces; but this ample domain was alienated by
the imprudence or distress of succeffive princes3 and their revenue,
from minute and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the
maintenance of their household. Their troops were formed by the
legal or voluntary service of their feudal vaffals‚ who passed the Alps
with reludhince, assumed the licence of rapine and disorder, and
capricioussy deserted before the end of the campaign. Whole
armies were swept away by the pestilential influence of the cli-

nobles ¹⁴², and the effeffi‘ts of their own intemperance were often im-

might contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy 3 nor
