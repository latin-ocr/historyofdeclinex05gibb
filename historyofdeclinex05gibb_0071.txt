ral and religious virtues was suspeeted by the persons who had passed VN
their lives in hisfamiliar confidence. In his last hours, when he was
pressed by his wife Irene to alter the succeffion', he raised his head,
and breathed a pious ejaculation on the vanity of this world. The
indignant reply of the empress may be inscribed as an epitaph on his
