In the rude idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manifest and auda-
cious: the Sabians are poorly excused by the pre-eminence of the
first planet, or intelligence‚ in their coelestial hierarchy3 and in the
Magiam system the confliet of the two principles betrays the imper-
fedlion of the conqueror. The Christiane of the {eventh century had
insenlibly relapsed into a semblance of paganism: their public and
private vows were addreffed to the relies and images that disgraced
the temples of the East: the throne of the Almighty was darkencd
by a cloud of martyre, and saints, and angels, the objeets of popular
veneration 3 and the Collyridian heretics, who flourissied in the fruit-
