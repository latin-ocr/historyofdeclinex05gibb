W, without giving himself an equal, to reward the piety of his brother

Isaac, the crafty Alexius interpol'ed a new and supereminent dignity.
The happy flexibility of the Greek tongue allowed him to compound
the names of Augustus and emperor (Sebastos and Autocrator)‚ and
the union produced the sonorous title of Sequstocrator. He was ex-
alted above the Caesar on the first step of the throne: the public
acclamations repeated his name 3 and he was only distinguished from
the sovereign by some peculiar ornaments of the head and feet.
The emperor alone could affume the purple or red buskins, and the
close diadem or tiara, which imitated the fashion of the Persian
kings ⁴⁰. It was an high pyramidal cap of eloth or silk, almost
concealed by a profufion of pearls and jewels: the crown was
formed by an horizontal circle and two arches of gold ι at the surn-
mit, the point of their intersection was placed a globe or cross, and
two strings or lappets of pearl depended on either cheek. Instead
of red, the buskins of the Sebastocrator and Caesar were green3 and
on their open coronets or crowns, the precious gems were more
sparingly distributed. Befide and below the Caesar, the fancy of
Alexius created the Panhypwstbcstos and the Protcffcbfstos, whose
sound and signification will stitisfy a Grecian ear. They imply a
superiority and a priority above the simple name of Augustus; and this
sacred and primitive title of the Roman prince was degraded to the
kinsmen and servants of the Byzantine court. The daughter of
Alexius applauds, with fond complacency, this artful gradation of
hopes and honours3 but the science of words is aceeffible to the
meanest capacity3 and this vain di&ionary was easily enriched by
the pride of his suceefl'ors. To their favourite sons or brothers, they
