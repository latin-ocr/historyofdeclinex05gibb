rience of discord and weakness recommended the more simple and
vigorous administration of a fingle person. The sceptre which had
been declined by the modest Lebedias, was granted to the birth or
merit of Almus and his son Arpad, and the authority of the supreme
khan of the Chazars confirmed the engagement of the prince and

tration of modern learning had not opened a new and larger prospe&
of the antiquities of nations. The Hungarian language stands alone,
and as it were insulated, among the Sclavonian dialee‘ts 3 but it bears
a close and clear affinity to the idionis of the Fennic sacen, of an
obsolete and sava'ge race, which formerly occupied the northern
regions of Asia and Europe. The genuine appellation of Ugri or
{grows is found on the western confines of China²³3 their migration
to the banks of the Irtiffi is attested by Tartar evidence ²⁴3 a similar
name and language are dete&ed in the southern parts of Siberia ²⁵3

and the remains of the Fennic tribes are widely, though ffiinly,

²² Fischer, in the Qatstiones Petropoli-
tanae, de Origine Ungrorum‚ and Pray,
Diss'ertat. i, ii, iii. &c. have drawn up several
comparative :ables of the Hungarian with the
Pennicdiaieeks. The affinityisindeed striking,
but the lists are short, the words are purpose-
ly chosen3 and I read in the learned Bayer
(Comment.Academ.Petropol.tom.x. p.374.),
that although the Hungarian has adopted many
Fennic words (innumeras voces), it effenxially

(Travels‚ vol. i. p. 174.) found the Vogulitz
in the neighbourhood of Tobolsky. By the
tortures of the etymological art, Ugur and
Vogul are reduced to the samename3 the cir-
cumjacent mountains really bear the appella-
tion of Ugrian3 and of all the Fennic dia-
lcets, the Vogulian is the nearest to the
Hungarian (Fischer, Dissert. i. p. :zo—30.
