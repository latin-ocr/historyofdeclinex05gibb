THE DECLINE AND FALL

both in this world and the next ² . I am not at leisure to examine

how fat the monks provoked, nor how much they have exaggerated‚
their real and pretended sufferings‚ nor how many lost their lives ot
limbs, their eyes or their beards, by the cruelty of the emperor.
From the chassisement of individuals, he proceeded to the abolition
of the order; and, as it was wealthy and useless, his resentment
might be stimulated by avarice and justified by patriotism. The

formidable name and miffion of the Drag071'⁴‚ his visitor-general,
excited the terror and abhorrence of the black nation: the religious

communities were diffolved3 the buildings were converted into
magazines, or barracks ; the lands, moveableS, and cattle, were con-
fiscated ; and our modern precedents will support the charge, that
much wanton or malicious havock was exercised against the relies,
and even the books, of the monasteries. With the habit and pro-
fession of monks, the public and private worship of images was
rigoroussy proscribed 3 and it should seem, *that a solemn abjuration
of idolatry was exasted from the subjefis, or at least from the clergy,

of the Eastern empire ²⁵.

were fondly cherished, and vigoroussy defended, by the independent
zeal of the Italians. In ecclcfiastical rank and jurisdifiion, the pa-
triarch of Constantinople and the pope of Rome were nearly equal.
