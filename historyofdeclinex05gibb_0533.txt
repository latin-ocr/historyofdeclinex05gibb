OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

The Gnostics, who had distracted the infancy, were oppreffed by
the greatness and authority, of the church. Instead of emulating or
surpaffing the wealth, learning, and numbers, of the Catholics, their
obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of theEast and west,
and confined to the villages and mountains along the borders of the
Euphrates. Some vestige of the Marcionites may be detected in
the fifth century²3 but the numerous sects were finally lost in the
odious name of the Manichaeans 3 and these heredes, who presumed
to reconcile the doctrines of Zoroaster and Christ, were pursued by
the two religions with equal and unrelenting hatred. Under the
grandson of Heraclius, in the neighbourhood of Samosata, more fa—

of truth. In his humble dwelling of Mananalis, Constantine en-

by Constantine and his fellow-labourers: the names of the apostolic
churches were applied to the congregations which they affembled
