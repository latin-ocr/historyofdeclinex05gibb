180 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C ΗΒΑ P. on the character and country of the Arabs. Many ages before Ma-
Q hornet ²⁶, their intrepid valour had been severely felt by their neigh-
bom-s in offensu-e and defensive war. The patient and adlive vir-
tues of a soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits and discipline of
a pastoral life. The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to
the women of the tribe 3 but the martial youth under the banner of
the emir, is ever on horeseback, and in the field, to praCtise the
exercise of the bow, the javefin, and the scymetar. The long me-

morysof their independence is the firmest pledge of its perpetuity‚
and succeeding generations are animated to prove their descent and

to maintain their inheritanee. Their domestic feuds aresuspended on
the approach of a common enemy3 and in their last hostilities against
the Turks‚ the caravan of Mecca was attacked and pillaged by four-
score thousand of the confederates. XVhen they advance to battle, the
hope of vi&ory is in the front; in the rear, the affurance of a retreat.
Their horses and camels, who in eight or ten days can perform a

march of four or five hundred miles, disappear before the conqueror ; -

the secret waters of the desert elude his search3 and his victorious
troops are consumed with thirst‚ hunger, and fatigue‚ in the pur-
suit of an invisible foe, who scorns his efforts, and safely reposes in
the heart of the burning solitude. The arms and desei-ts of the
Bedoweens are not only the safeguards of their own freedom, but
the barriers also of the happy Arabia, whose inhabitants, remote
from war, are enervated by the luxury of the soil and climate. The
legions of Augustus melted away in disease and laffitude²⁷3 and it
