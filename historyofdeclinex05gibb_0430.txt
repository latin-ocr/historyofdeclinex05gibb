THE DECLINE AND FALL

the Edriffites of Mauritania, and the more powerfnl Fatimites of
Africa and Egypt. In the tenth century, the chair of I'vlahvomet was
disputed by three caliphs or commanders of the faithful, who reigned
at Bagdad‚ Cairoan, and· Cordova, excommunicated each other, and
agreed only in a principle of . discord, that a seetary ἰε more odious
and criminal than an unbeliever ⁴⁰.

M'ecea was the patrimony of the line of Hashem, yet the Ab-
baffides were never tempted to- reside either in the birth-place or
the city of the prophet. Damascus was disgraced by the choice, and
polluted with the blood, of the Ommiades3 and after some hesita-
tion, Almanspr, the brother and succeffor of Saffah, laid the found-
ations of Bagdad 4¹, the Imperial seat of his posterity during a reign
of five hundred years ⁴². The chosen spot is on the eastern bank of
the Tigris about fifteen miles above the ruins of Modain ε 'the double
wall was of a circular form3 and such was the rapid encrease of a
capital, now dwindled to a provincial town, that the funeral of a
popular saint might be attended by eight hundred thousand rnen and
fixty thousand women of Bagdad and the adjacent villages. In this

⁴⁰ Ι shall not stop to refute the strange
errors and fancies of Sir William Temple
(his works, vol. iii. p. 371—374. octavo
edition) and Voltaire (Histoire Generale,
c. xxviii. tom. ii. p. 124, ης. edition de
Lausanne)‚ concerning the division of the Sa-
racen empire. The mistakes of Voltaire
proceeded from the want of knowledge or
refleffion; but Sir William was deceived by
a Spanith impostor, who has framed an apo-
cryphal history of the conquest of Spain by
the Arabs.

4¹ The geographer d’Anville (l’Euphrate et
le Tigre, p. 121—123.)‚ and the Orientalist
d‘Herbelot (Bibliotheque‚ p. 167, 168), may
suffice for the knowledge of Bagdad. Our
ravellen, Pietro dena Valle (tom. i. p. 688

——698.)‚ Tavernier (tom. i. p.z30-238.)‚
Thevenot (part ii. p. 209—-212.)‚ Otger
(tom. i. p. 162—168.)‚ and Niebuhr (voy-
age en Arabie, tom. ii. p. 239—271.)‚ have
seen only its decay3 and the Nubian geogra-
pher (p. ²04·) and the travelling Jew, Benja-
min of Tudela (itinerarium, p. 112—123. ὲ
Const. l’Empereur, apud Elzevir, 1633), are
the only writers ofmy acquaintance,whohave
known Bagdad under the reign of the Ab·
baffides. ’

4² The foundations os Bagdad were laid
A.H. 145, AD. 762. Mostastm, the last
ofthe Abbaffides, was taken and put to deaxh
by the Tartars, A‚H. 656, ΑΛ). 1258, the
