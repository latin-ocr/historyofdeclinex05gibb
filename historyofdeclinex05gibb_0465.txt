Instead of a regular sup-

with the ostentatious gift of an elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of

'⁰³ The dynasties of the Arabian empire
may be studied in the Annals of Elmacffl,
Abulpharagius‚ and Abulseda, under the
proper years, in the diffionary of d'Herbelot‚
under the proper names. The rables os M.
de Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i.) exhibit
ageneral chronology of the East, interspersed
with some historical anecdote55 but his at-
tachment to national blood has sometimes
confounded the order of time and place.

prosess‘ed subject of M. de Cardonne (Hist. de
I'Asrique et de l’Espagne sous la Domina·

be founded in the year of the Hegira 173,
fince the founder was a posthumam child of a
descendant of Ali, who fled from Mecca in
the year 168. z. This founder, Edris the

son of Edris, instead of living to the impro-
bable age of 120 years, A. H. 313, died
A. Η. 214, in the prime osmanhood. 3. The
dynasty ended A. Η. 307, twenty-three years
sooner than it is fixed by the historian of the
Huns. See the accurate Annals ofAbulfeda‚
p. 158, 159. 185. 238.

¹⁰⁶ The dynasties of the Taherites and
Soffarides, with the rise os that of the Sama-
nides, are described in the original history
and Latin verfion of Mirchond: yet the most
interesting safts had already been drained by
the diligence of M. d’Herbelor.
