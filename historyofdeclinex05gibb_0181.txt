OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 157

merated by Abulfeda, the most ancient and populous were fimare C H Α 1³.
in the happy Yemen z the towers of Saana ¹⁵, and the marvellous re· ᾡς
servoir of Merab ¹⁶, were constru&ed by the kings of the Homerites;

but their profane lustre was eclipsed by the prophetie glories of

MEDINA ¹⁷ and MECCA ¹⁸, near the Red Sea, and at the distance from

each other of two hundred and seventy miles. The last of these holy Mecea3
places was known to the Greeks under the name of Macoraba3 and

the termination of the word is expreffive of its greatness‚ which has

not indeed, in the most flourishing period, exceeded the slze and
populousness of Marseilles. Some latent motive‚ perhaps of super-
stitio-n, must have impelled the founders, in·the choice of a most un-
promifing situation. They eredied their habitations of mud or stone,
in a plain about two miles long and one mile broad, at the foot of
three barren mountains: the soil is a rock3 the water even of the

holy well of Zemzem is bitter or brackish 3 the pastures are remote

reckons one hundred and fixty-four towns in
Arabia Foelix. The fize of the towns might
be small—the fa'uh of the writer might be
lare-ze.

¹⁵ It is compared by Abulfeda (in Hudson,
tom. iii. p. 54.) to Damascus, and is still the
refidence of the Imam of Yemen (Voyages
de Niebuhr, tom. i. p. 331—342.). Saana
is twenty-four parasangs from Dafar (Abul-
seda, p. 51.), and fixty-eight from Aden

(pm Pdcock, Specimen‚ P·57- Geograph.
Nubiensis, p. ΞΖ. Medaba, or Merab, fix
miles in circumference‚ was destroyed by the
legions of Augustus(P1in.Hist. Nat. vi. 3²·)²
and had not revived in the 2<iv¹h century
(Abulfed. Descript. Arab. p. 58.).

¹⁷ The name of city, Medina, was appro-
priated, 22? ῑξιχιςι, to Yatreb (the [atrippa
of the Greeks), the seat of the prophet. The
distances srom Medina :ue reckoned by Abul-
seda in statione, or days juurney of a caravan
(p. 13.): to Bahrein, xv3 to Bassum, xviii;

Saana (p. 5²⁴) or Aden, xxm to Cairo, xxxi
days, or 412 hours (Shaw's vaels, p. 477.);
which, according to the estimate of d'An-
ville (Mesures Itineraires, p. 99), allows
about twenty-five English miles for a day's
journey. From the land of frankincense
(Hadramaut‚ in Yemen, between Aden and
Cape Fartascli) to Gaza, in Syria, Pliny
(Hist. Nat. xii. 3²·) computes lxv mansions
of camels. These measures may affist fancy
and elucidate fae‘ts.

¹³ Our notions of Mecca must be drawn
from the Arabians (d’Herbe-lot, Bibliotheque
Orientale, p. 368—371. Pocock, Specimen,
p. πῆς-ηδ. Abulfeda, p. 11—40.). As
no unbeliever is permitrcd to enter the¹ city,
our travellers are silent3 and the short hints
of Therenot (Voynges do Levant, parti. p.
490.) are tal-:en from the suspicions mouth of
an African renegac'o. Seme Perlians count-
ed 6000 houses (Chardin, tom. iv. p. 167.).
