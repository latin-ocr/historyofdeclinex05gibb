exempts from all personal taxes the mariners of Peloponesus, and
the workmen in parchment and purple. This denomination may
be fairly applied or extended to the manufactures of linen, woollen,
and more especially of filk: the two former of which had flourished
in Greece since the days of Homer; and the last was introduced
perhaps as early as the reign of Justinian. These arts, which were
exer-cised at Corinth, Thebes, and Argos, afforded food and occupa-

distributed according to their age and strength 3 and if many of these
were domestic ssaves, their masters, who directed the work and en-
joyed the profit, were of a free and honourable condition. The
gifts which a rich and generous matron of Peloponesus presented to
the emperor Bafil, her adopted son, were doubtless fabricated in the
Grecian looms. Danielis bestowed a carpet of fine wool, of a pat-
tern which imitated the spots of a peacock’s tau, of a magnitude to
overspread the floor of a new chureh, erected in the triple name
of Christ, of Michael the archangel, and of the prophet Elijah. She
gave fix hundred pieces of fill< and linen, of various use and deno-
mination : the filk was painted with the Tyrian dye, and adorned by
the labours of the needle ; and the linen was so exquisitcly fine, that
an entire piece might be rolled in the hollow of a cane ²³.
