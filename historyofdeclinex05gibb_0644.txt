sole labour) of climbing the hill ; their general, from the command-

heaven, by tear-ing from the altar the precious image of Theodore
the tutelary saint. The filk weavers of both sexes, whom George
transported to Sicily, composed the most valuable part of the spoil,
and in comparing the skilful industry of the mechanic with the ssoth
and cowardice of the soldier, he was heard .to exclaim, that the
,distaff and loom were >the only weapons which the Greeks were ca—

by two conspicuous events, the arescue of ‹the king of France‚ and
the insult of the Byzantine capital. In vhis return by sea from an
unfortunate crusade, Louis ⁴the feventh -was intercepted by the
Greeks, who basely violated the laws of honour and religion. The
