472 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C HIA P· The provinces that still adhered to the empire were repeopled and

From the yoke of the caliphs, the Catholics of Syria, Egypt, and
Africa, retired to the allegiance of their prince, to the society of their

encouraged to build new cities and to cultivate waste lands; and
many spots, both in Europe and Asta, preserved the name, the
manners, or at least the memory, of these national colonies. Even
the tribes of Barbarians, who had seated themselves in arms on the
territory of the empne, vvere gradually reclaimed to the laws of the
church and state; and as long as they were separated from the
Greeks, their posterity supplied a race of faithful and obedient sol-
diers. Did we poffess sufficient materials to survey the twenty-nine
