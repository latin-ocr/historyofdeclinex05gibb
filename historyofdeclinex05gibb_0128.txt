124 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {Im}- P. dominion, and the world beheld for the first time a Christian bissiop
h--v—-d invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince3 the choice
of magistrates, the exercise of justice, the'imposition of taxes, and
the wealth of the palace of Ravenna. In the tliss'olution of the
Lombard kingdom, the inhabitants of the dutchy of Spoleto ⁶⁴
fought a refuge from the storm‚ shaved their heads after the Roman
fashion, declared themselves the servants and subjeets of St. Peter,
and completed, by this voluntary surrender‚ the present circle of the
ecclefiastical state. That mysterious circle was enlarged to an inde-
finite extent, by the verbal or written donation of Charlemagne‘⁵,
Who, in the first transports of his viCtory, despoiled himself and the
Greek emperor of the cities and iflands which had formerly been
annexed to the Exarchate. But, in'the cooler moments of absence
and refieition, he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the re-
cent greatness of his ecclefiastical ally. The execution of his own
and his father’s promises was respedtfully eluded: the king of the
Franks and Lornbards afferted the inalienable rights of the empire ;
and, in his life and death, Ravenna ⁶⁶, as well as Rome, was num-
bered in the list of his metropolitan cities. The sovereignty of the
Exarchate melted away in the hands of the popes: they found in the

archbilhops of 'Ravenna a dangerous and domestic rival ⁶⁷: the
nobles

⁶⁴ Spoletini deprecati sunt, ut eos in ser-

.viti0 B. Petri reciperet et more Romanorum

tonsurari faceret (Anastasius, p. 185.). Yet
it may be a question whether they gave their
own persons or their country.

⁶⁵ The policy and donations of Charle-
magne are carefully examined by St. Marc
(Abi-ege, tom. i. p. 390—408.), who has
well studied the Codex Carolinus. Ι believe,
with him, that they were only verbal. The
most ancient a& of donation that pretends to
be extant, is that of the emperor Lewis the
I'ious (Sigonius, de Regno ltaliae, 1. iv. O-

pera, tom. ἰὶ. p. 267—:7o.). Its authenti-
city, or at least its integrity, are much ques-
tioned (Pagi, A. D. 817, Νο 7, διε. Mura-
tori, Annali, torn. vi. p. 432, διε. Dissertat.
Chorographica, p. 33, 34.); but I see no rea-
sonable objeffion to these princes so freely

dispofing of what was not their own.
⁶⁶ Charlemagne solicited and obtained from
the propriet0r‚ Hadrian Ι. the mosaics of the
palace of Ravenna, for the decoration of Αἰκ-
la-Chapelle (Cod. Carolin. epist. 67. p. 2²3·)·

ations of Leo of Ravenna (Codex Carolin.
