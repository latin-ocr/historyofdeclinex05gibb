to remove the inhabitants, and to abandon the empty structures to
the vain resentment of the Barbarians. The emperor embraced the
more generous resolution of defending‚ in a fiege and battle, the
country of his ancestors. When the armies drew near, thefront of

Turkish cavalry3 and had not their bow-strings been damped and
relaxed by the evening rain, very few of the Christiane could have

vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the inexorable
caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and promises; and de-=

statues of a lion and a bull. The vow of Motaffem was accom-
pushed with unrelenting rigour ; tired, rather than satiated‚ with de-
