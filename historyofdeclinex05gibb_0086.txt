THE DECLINE AND FALL

C Π Λ Ρ· the life of Andronicus. His memory was stored with a black list of

ι--Ὗ---ι the enemies and rivals, who had traduced„ his merit, opposed his

greatness, or insulted his missortunes3 and the only comfort of his
exile was the sacred hope and promise of revenge. The neceffaty
extinction of the young emperor and his mother, imposed the fatal
obligation of extirpating the friends, who hated, and might punish,
the affaffir13 and the repetition of murder rendered him less willing,
and less able, to forgive. An horrid narrative of the vistims whom

insenlibly filled with a curious and mournful crowd, who, in his sate,
prognosticated their own. But their lamentations were soon turned
