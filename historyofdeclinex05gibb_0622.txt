dignity: in his triumphal progress through Apulia and Calabria, Mi-

pope Gregory the seventh exhorted the bishops to preach, and the Ca-

the East. Yet this Michael, by the confeffion of the Greeks and Latins,

was a pageant and impostor 3 a monk who had fled from his convent,
or a domestic who had served in the palace. The fraud had been
contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this pre-
tender had given a decent colour to his arms, he would smk, at the
nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity. But victory
was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks ;

the representative of the emperor Michael. Thirteen hundred
