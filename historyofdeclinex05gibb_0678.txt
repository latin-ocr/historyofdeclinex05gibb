Q.) Mossems who were in the power of the Greeks. Romanus, with
a figh‚ subscribed this treaty‚ so disgraceful to the majesty of the
empire3 he was immediately invested with a Turkilh robe of honour;
his nobles and patricians were restored to their sovereign3 and the
sultan, after a courteous embrace, dismissed him with rich presents'
and a military guard. No sooner did he reach the confines of the
empire, than he was informed that the palace and provinces had dif-
claimed their allegiance to a captive: a sum of two hundred thou-
sand pieces was painfully colle&ed; and the fallen monarch trans-
mitted this part of his ransom, with a sad confeffion of his· impo-
tence and disgrace. The generofity‚ or perhaps the ambition, of
the fustan, prepared to espouse the cause of his ally ; but his defigns
were prevented by the defeat, imprisonment‚ and death, of Romanus
Diogenes ³³.

Death of Δ In the treaty of peace, it does not appear that Alp Arssan ex-

ffpffirfgss torted any province or city from the captive emperor3 and his
revenge was satisfied with the trophies of his νὶἇὶοτγ, and the spoils
of Anatolia‚ from Antioch to the Black Sea. The fairest part of
Asia was subject to his laws: twelve hundred princes, or the sons of
princes, stood before his throne; and two hundred thousand soldiers
marehed under his banners. The sultan disdained to pursue the fugi-
tive Greeks; but he meditated the more glorious conquest of Turk-
estam, the original seat of the house of Seljuk. He moved from
Bagdad to the banks of the Oxus3 a bridge was thrown over the

river3 and twenty days were consumed in the paffage of his troops.
