of the north eradicated what yet remained of their fickly and wither- Μ

ed roots. In this irruption, the country and the inhabitants were
transformed3 the Grecian blood was contaminated3 and the proudest
nobles of Peloponesus'were branded with the names of foreigncrs
and ssaves. By the diligence of succeeding princes, the land was in
some measure purified from the Barba1·i]ns; and the humble rem-
nant was bound by an¹ oath of obedience, tribute, and military ser-
vice, which they Often renewed and often violatcd. The fiege of
Patras was formedby'a fingular concurrence of the sclavonia-ns of
Peloponesus and 'the Saracens of Africa. In their last distress, a
pious fiction of the approach of the praetor of Corinth, revived the
courage of the citizens. Their sally was bold and successfu13 the
strangers embarked‚ the rebels submittat, and the glory of the day
was ascribed to a phantom or a stranger, who fought in the foremost
ranks under the character of St. Andrew the apostle. The shrine
which contained his relies was decorated with the trophies of vic-
tory, and the captive race was for ever devoted to the service and
vaffalage of the Metropolitan church of Patras. By the revolt of
two Sclavonian tribes in the neighbourhood of Helos and Lacedae-
mon, the peace of the peninsula was often disturbcd. They some-
times insulted the weakness, and sometimes refisted the oppreffion, of
the Byzantine government, till at length the approach of their hostile
brethren extorted a golden bull to define the rights and obligations

of the Ezzerites and Milengi, whose annual tribute was defined at
twelve hundred pieces of gold. From these strangers the Imperial
geographer has accurately distinguished a domestic and perhaps ori-
ginal race, who, in some degree, might derive their blood from

the much injured Helots. The liberality of the Romans, and espe- Freemgn of

cially of Augustus, had enfranchised the maritime cities from the
