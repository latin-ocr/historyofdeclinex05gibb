THE DECLINE AND FALL

from the Mahometan conquerors. These troopS, doubly iufec'ted
with mercenary and fanatic vices, were delirous of revolting against
their benefactor, and erecting the standard of their native king:
but the loyal Theophobus rejected their offers, disconcerted their
schemes, and escaped from their hands to the camp or palace of his

prince could only observe, that, in this world, women had been the
cause of much evil: ‘⁴ And surely, slr,” she pertly replied, “ they
