to save the blood of the Mossems by a single combat3 but his
trembling rival declined the challenge as a sentence of inevitable
death. The ranks of the Syrians were broken by the charge of a
hero who was mounted on a pyebald horse, and wielded with iire-
sistible force his ponderous and two-edged sword. As often as he

smote a rebel, he shouted the Allah Acbar, “ God is vi&orioiis;'’
and in the tumult of a noeturnal battle, he was heard to repeat four
hundred times that tremendous exclamation. The prince of Da-
mascus already meditated his ssight, but the certain vic'tory was
snatched from the grasp of Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm
of his troops. Their conscience was awed by the solemn appeal to
the books of the Koran which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost
lances ; and Ali was compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an
insidious compromise. He retreated with sorrow and indignation
to Cufa3 his party was discouraged; the distant provinces of Persia,
of Yemen, and of Egypt, were subdued or seduced by his crafty
rival ; and the stroke of fanaticism which was aimed against the three
chiefs of the nadon, was fatal only to the cousm of Mzihomer. In

deaths of Ali, of lN'Ioawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the viceroy
of Egypt, would restore the peace and unity of religion. Each of
the affaffins chose his vietim, poisoned his dagger, devoted his life,
and secretly repaired to the scene of anion. Their resolution was
equally desperate: but the first mistook the person ‚of Amrou, and
stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat; the prince of Damascus .
