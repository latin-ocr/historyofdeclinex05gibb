converted or seduced by his arguments; and he preached with suc-

cess in the regions of Pontus ¹⁰ and Cappadocia, which had long since

imbibed the religion of Zoroaster. The Paulician teachers were dis-

tinguished only by their scriptural names, by the modest title of
fellow-pilgrims‚ by the austerity of their lives, their zeal or know-
ledge, and the credit of some extraordinary gifts of the holy spirit.
But they were incapable of defiring, or at least of obtaining, the
wealth and honours of the Catholic prelacy: such anti-christian
pride they bitterly censured3 and even the rank of elders or presby-
ters was condemned as an institution of the Jewish synagogue. The

westward of the Euphrates; fix of their principal congregatione re-

by the Medes (Herodot. l. i. c. 103.) and
Perfians; and the kings of Pontus were of
the royal race of the Achaemenides (Salust.

ment and notes of the president de Bross‘es).
