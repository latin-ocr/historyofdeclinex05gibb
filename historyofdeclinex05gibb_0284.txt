barley-bread or dates; his drink was water3 he preached in a gown
that was torn or tattered in twelve places ; and a Persian satrap who
paid his homage to the conqueror, found him asseep among the
beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina. Oeconomy is the
source of liberality‚ and the encrease of the revenue enabled Omar to
establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present services
of the faithful. Careless of his own emolument, he affigned to Abbas,
the uncle of the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of
twenty-five thousand drams or pieces of filver. Five thousand were
allotted to each of the aged warriors, the relies of the field of Beder,
and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was distin-
guished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One thou-
sand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first bat-

exercised in the school of civil discord, were more usefully applied
to propagate the saith and dominion of the prophet. In the ssoth
