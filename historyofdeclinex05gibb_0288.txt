THE DECLINE AND FALL

C IiIA P. race of kings who had embraced the Christian religion, and reigned

u-—v-ss-a above six hundred years under the ssiadow of the throne of Perfia¹⁶.

Battle of
eadefia,
A. D. 036.

The last of the Mondars was defeated and [lain by Caled3 his son was
sent a captive to Medin213 his nobles bowed before the succeffor of the
prophet3 the people was tempted by the example and success of their
countrymen3 and the caliph accepted as the first fruits of foreigr!
conquest, an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of gold. The
conquerors‚ and even their historiatis, were astonifhed by the dawn
of their future greatness: “ In the same year‚” says Elmacin, ‘⁶ Caled
“ fought many signal battles ; an immense multitude of the infidels
“ was ssaughtered3 and spoils, infinite and innumerable, were acquired
“ by the victorious Mossems '⁷.'’ But the invincible Caled was
soon transferred to the Syrian war : the invafion of the Perfian
frontier was conducted by less aCtive or less prudent commanders:
the Saracens were repulsed with loss in the paffage of the Euphrates;
and, though they chastised the insolent pursuit of the Magians, their
remaining forces still hovered in the desert of Babylon. “
The indignation and fears of the Perfians suspended for a- moment
their intestine divisions. By the unanimous sentence of the priests*
and nobles, their queen Arzema was deposed; the sixth of the tran-
sient usurpers, who had arisen and vanissied in three or four year-'sy
since the death of Chosroes and the retreat of Heraclius. Her tiara

was placed on the head of Yezdegerd, the· grandson of chosroes ;·
