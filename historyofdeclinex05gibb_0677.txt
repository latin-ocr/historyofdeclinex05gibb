violate in the hands of a prince who had learned to respect the ma-
jesty of his equals and the viciffitudes of fortune. From the divam,
Romanus was conducted to an adjacent tent, where he was served
with pomp and reverence hythe officers of the sultan, who, twice
each day, seated him in the place of honour at his own table. In
a free and familiar conversation of eight days, not a word, not a
look, of insult, escaped from the conqueror3 but he severely cen-
sured the unworthy subjeos who had deserted their valiant prince in
the hour of danger, and gently admonished his antagonist of some
errors which he had committed in the management of the war. In
the preliminaries of negociation, Alp Arssan asked him what treat-
ment he expe&ed to receive, and the calm indifference of the em-
peror displays' the freedom of his mind. “ If you are cruel,” said
he, “ you will take my life; if you listen to pride, you will drag
“ me at your chariot wheels; if you consult your interest, you will
“ accept a ransom, and restore me to my country.” “ And what,”
continued the sultam, “ would have been your own behaviour, had
“ fortune smiled on your arms ?'' The reply of the Greek betrays a
sentiment, which prudence, and even gratitude, ffiould have taught
him to suppress. “ Had Ι vanquissied,” he fiercely said, “ I would

“ have inflicted on thy body many a stripe-’⁹ The Turkish con—
queror smiled at the insolence of his captive; observed that the
Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and forgiveness of in·

juries; and nobly declared, that he would not imitate an example
which he condemned. After mature deliberation, Alp Arssan dic-
tated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million, Van
annual tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces of gold ³⁷,

reason and the Orientals. The other Greeks Ῥωμαιων, αρχῃς, and that the emperor would
