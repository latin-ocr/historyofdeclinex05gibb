OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 553

After some experience of the Roman taolies, they adopted the use C ῙῖνΑ Ρ·
of the sword aud spear, the helmet of the soldier, and the iron k--v--q

breast-plate of his steed: but their native and deadly weapon was
the Tartar bow: from the earliest infancy, their children and ser-
