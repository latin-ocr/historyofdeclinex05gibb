these savage foes might have been compared by Homer to the two
lions growling over the carcase of a mangled stag³⁵.

The deliverance of Germany and Christendorn was atchieved by
the Saxon prince8‚ Henry the Fowler and Otho the Great, who, in
two memorable battles, for ever broke the power of the Hunga-
rians³⁶. The valiant Henry was roused from a bed of sickness by
the invasion of his country: but his mind was vigorous and his

the best evidence sor the former, and
Witichind (Annal. Saxon. l. iii.) of the
latter: but the critical historiari will not even
overlook the horn of a warrior, which is
said to be preserved at Jaz-berin.
