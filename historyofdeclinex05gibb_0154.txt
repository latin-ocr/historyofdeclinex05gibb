¹50 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C >2³12 ¹²-- French ambaffadors were the speoators, and had nearly been the
ι--νζ-’.ι νὶξὶίῐτιε, of the conspiracy of Nicephorus, and the national hatred.
Constantinople was exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of an·

the emperor. The same mistake, and the same answer, were re-
peated in the apartments of the count palatine, the steward, and the
chamberlain ; and their impatience was gradually heightened, till the
doors of the presence-chamber vvere thrown open, and they beheld

which he despised, and encircled with the love and revel-enee of his
vietor-‘rous chiefs. A treaty of peace and alliance was concluded be-
tween the two empires, and the limits of the East and Wcst were
