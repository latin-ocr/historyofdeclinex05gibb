272 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C H A P· The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our applause, but his suc-
2-L'—1 cess has perhaps too strongly attraeted our admiration. Are we sur-
Rfssfigssgf prised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the doCtrine
and the passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the herefies of the chureh,
the same seduCtion has been tried and repeated from the time of the
apostles to that of the reformers. Does it seem incredible that a pri-
vate citizen should grasp the sword and the sceptre, subdue his native
country, and erect a monarchy by his victorious arms? In the
moving picture of the dynasties of the East, an hundred fortunate
usurpers have arisen from a bafer origin, s urmounted more formidable
obstacles‚ and filled a larger scope of empire and conquest. Ma-
homet was alike instruCted to preach and to fight‚ and the union of
these opposite qualities, while it enhanced his merit, contributed to
his success : the operation of force and persuafion, of enthufiasm and

sear, continually adted on each other, till every barrier yielded to

 

their irrefistible power. His voice invited the Arabs to freedom and

victory, to arms and rapine, to the indulgence of their (larling pas-

slons in this world and the other3 the restraints which he im-

posed were requifite to establish the credit of the prophet, and to '¹'

exercise the obedience of the pcople3 and the only objection to

his success, was his rational crced of the unity and perfectioris of 2
Permaneqcy God. It is not the propagation but the permanency of his religion ’
ἓξῡξῖεκὴ- that descrves our wonder: the same pure and perfect impreffion Ι

which he engraved at Mecca and Medma, is preserved, after the ’ῑῇ

revolutione, of twelve centuries, by the Indian, the Africm, and the

Turkish proselytes of the Koran. If the Christian apostleS, St. Peter

οι· St. Paul, could return to the Vatican, they might poffibly enquire

the name of the Dcity who is xx·oi·ss1ippe(l with such mysterious

sites in that magnificent temple: at Oxford or Geneva, they would

experience less surprise 3 but it might still bc incumbent on them to

peruse thc ca'techifin of the chureh, and to study the orthodox com-
