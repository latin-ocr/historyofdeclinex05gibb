OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

checked for a moment the genius of Charlemagne; so liberal in
peace, that they maintained in their capital an academy of thirty-
two philosophers and grammarians. The divifion of this flourissr-
ing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento, Salerno, and
Capua3 and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competi-

During a calamitous period of· two hundred years, Italy was ex-
