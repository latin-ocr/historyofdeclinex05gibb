z-aev—..a description3 and the pid'ture may be heightened by some strokes

from their contemporaries of the tenth century. Except the merit
and fame of military prowess, all that is valued by mankind ap-
peared vile and contemptible to these Barbarians, whose native fierce-
ness was stimulated by the consciousness of numbers and freedom.
The tents of the Hungarians were of leather, their garments of fur;
they ssiaved their hair and scarified their faces: in speech they were
ssow, in aetion prompt, in treaty perfidious ; and they {bared the
common reproach of Barbarians, too ignorant to conceive the im-
portance of nuth, too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their
most solemn engagements. Their simplicity has been praised; yet
they abstained only from the luxury they had never known3 what-
ever they saw, they coveted; their desires were insatiam, and their
sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. By the defini-
tion ofa pastoral nation, Ι have reealled a long description of the
oeconomy, the warfaoe, and the government that prevail in that stage
of society3 Imay add, that to fishing as well as to the chace, the
Hungarians were indebted for a part of their suhfistence, and since
they stldom cultivated the ground, they must, at least in their new
settlement5‚ have sometimes praffised a ssight and unsszilful hus-
bandry. In their emigrations, perhaps in their expeditions‚ the
host was accompanied by thousands of sheep and exeri, who en-
creased the cloud of formidable dust‚ and afforded a constant and
wholesome supply of mill< and animal food. A plentisul command
of forage was the first care of the genem-il, and if the flocks and herds
were secure of their pastures‚ the hardy warrior was alike insensible
of danger and fatigue. The confusion of men and cattle that over-
spread the country exposed their camp to a no&urnal surprise, had
not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry, perpe-
tually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the enemy.
