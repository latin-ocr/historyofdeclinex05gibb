from wine and flesh. In the sixty-eighth year of his age, his mar-
tial spirit urged him to embark in person for a holy war against the
Saracens of Sicily3 he was prevented by death, and Bafil, surnamed
the Slayer of the Bulgarians, was dismissed from the world, with
the bleffings of theclergy and the curses of the people. After his

102 ‚ decease, his brother Constantine enjoyed, about three years, the power,

or rather the pleasures, of royalty; and his only care was the settle-
ment of the succeffion. He had enjoyed‚:fixty-fix years, the title
of Augustus3 and the reign of the two brothers is the longest,
and most obscure, of the Byzantine history.

A lineal succeflion of five emperorS, in a period of an hundred

1⁵32 , and fixty years, had attached the loyalty of the Greeks to the Mace-

donian dynasty, which had been thrice respee‘ted by the usurpers of
their power. After the death of Constantine the ninth‚ the last male
of the royal race, a new and broken scene presents itself, and the ac-
cumulated years-of twelve emperors do not equal the space of his
single reign. His elder brother had preferred his private chastity to
the public interest, and Constantine himself had only three daughters ;
Eudocia‚ who took the veil‚ and Zoe and Theodora, who were pre-

·served till a mature age in a state of ignorance and virginity. XVhen

their marriage was discufl'ed in the eouncil of their dying father, the
cold or pious Theodora refused to give an heir to the empire, but
her fister Zoe presented herself a willing viritim at the altar. Ro-
manus Argyrus, a patrician of a graceful person and fair reputation‚
was chosen for her husband, and, on his declining ‚that honour, was

Χ informed, that blindness or death was the second alternative. The

motive of his reluEtance was conjugal affection, but his faithful wife
sacrificed her own happiness to his safety and greatness; and her en-

trance into a monastery removed the only bar to the Imperial nup-
16 tials.
