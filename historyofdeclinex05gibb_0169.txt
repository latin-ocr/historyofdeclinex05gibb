with a distinguissied name and rank, the exclusive privilege of chusing
the Roman emper0r3 and these elec'tors were the king of Bohemia,
the duke of Saxony, the margi-ave of Brandenburgh, the count pala-
tine of the Rhine, and the three archbishops of Mentz‚ of Treves, and
of Cologne. II. The college of princes and prelates purged them-
selves of a promiscuous multitude: they reduced to four represent-
ative votes, the long series of independent counts, and excluded the
nobles or equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in the Polish

best legal and constitutional history that 1
know of any country (Nouvel Abrege' Chro-

His learning and judgment have discerned
the most interesting fans 3 his simple brevity
