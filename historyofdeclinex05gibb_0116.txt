THE DECLINE AND FALL
When the fove*

saw-*41 reignty of the Greek emperors was extinguithed, the ruins of Rome

jpresented the sad image of depopulation and decay: her ssavery was
an habit, her liberty an accident; the effe& of superstition, and the
obje& of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the
substance, or ev-en the forms, of the constitution, was obliterated
from the praefice and memory of the Romans ; and they were de-
void of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of a com-
monwealth. Their scanty temnant, the offspring of ssaves and stran-
gers, was despicable in the eyes 'of the viCtorious Barbarians. As
often as the Franks or Lombards expreffed their most bitter con·
tempt of a foe, they called him a Roman ς ,“ and in this name‚'' says
the bishop Liutprand, “ we include whatever is base, whatever is
“ cowardly‚ whatever is perfidious, the extremes of avarice and
“ luxury, and ‹every vice that can prostitute the dignity of human.
“ nature ⁴⁴.'' By the necessity of their fituati0n‚ the inhabitants of
Rome were cast into the rough model of a republican government:
they were compelled to ele& some judges in peace and some lead-
ers in war :- the nobles assembled to deliberate, and their resolves

could not be executed without the union and consent of the multi-.

tude.

lity for the early ages of Rome.

Minos might have imposed, as a fit penance‚
the daily perusal of this barbarous passage.
