OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

Palmyra derive a casual splendour from the nakedness of the sur-
rounding desert. Without injustice to his fame, I may discern
some blemilhes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the
VVel‘tern empire. Of his moral virtues, chastizy is not the most con-
spicuous⁹⁶: but the public happiness could not be materisilly injured
by his nine wives or concubines, the various indulgence of meaner
or more transient amours, the multitude of his bastards whom he
bestowed on the chureh, and the long celibacy and licentious man-

with too fond a passion. I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the
ambition of a conqueror3 but in a day of equal retributi0n‚ the
sons of his brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitain,

the emblem of his virtues, is found and per-

⁹⁷ The marriage of Eginhard with Imma,
daughter of Charlemagne, is, in my opinion,
sufficiently refuted by the probrum and sispi-
cio that sullied these fair damsels‚ without ex-
cepting his own wife (c. xix. p. 98—100.

of baptism. 2. The false pretence of bap-
