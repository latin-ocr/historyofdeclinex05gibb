The bloody shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damas-
cus: the emir deplored the fate of his injured ki11s1nan3 and sixty
thousand Syrians were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity
and revenge. Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt, himself an army,
was the first who saluted the new monarch, and divulged the danger-
ous secret, that the Arabiam caliphs· might be created elsewhere than
in the city of the prophet ¹⁷⁸. The policy of Moawiyah eluded the
valour of his rival; and, after the death of Ali, he negociated the
abdication of his son Hassan, whose mind was either above or below
the government of the world, and who retired without a sigh from
the palaee of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his grand-
father. The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally crowned by
the important change of an eleffive to an hereditary kingdom. Some
murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the reluctance of the
Arabs, and four citizens of Medina refused the oath of fidelity;
but the dciigns of Moawiyah were conducted with vigour and ad-
dress; and his son Yezid, a feeble and dissolute youth, was pro-
claimed as the commander of the faithful and the suceefl'or of the
apostle of God,

Ali. In serving at table, a ssave had inadvertently dropt a dish of
scalding broth on his master: the heedless wretch fell prostrate, to
deprecate his punishment, and repeated a verse o'f the Koran:

“ angryz''—“ and for those who pardon offences:'’-“ I pardon your}
