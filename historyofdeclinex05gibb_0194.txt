e—vss-ae eonvey to a philosophie, or even a vulgar, eye, the idea of boundless
space : the clm-aster of eternity is marked on these solid globes, that

seem incapahle of corruption or decay: the regularity of their mo·-

110113 may hc ascribed to a principle of reason οι· instinct ς and their

real or imaginary influence encourages the vain belief that the earth

of astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the

Arabs was a clear firmament and a naked plain. In their n0&urnal

marches, they steered by the guidance of the stars: their names, and .

order, anal daily station, were familiar to the curiosity and devotion

of the Bcdoween3 and he was taught by experience to divide in
twenty-eight parts, the zodiac of the moon, and to bless the constel-

slations who res1·ess-1ed, with salutary mins, the thirst of the desert.

The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended beyond the

in another life3 and the invocation of departed spirits implies that

they were still endowed with consciousness and power. I am igno-

of the local deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth, of their sex

or tides, their attributes or subordination. Each tribe, each family,

each independent warrior, created and changed the sites and the

obje& of his fantastic worship3 but the namon, in every age, has
