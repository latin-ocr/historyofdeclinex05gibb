OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 667

But the progress of the great king was retarded by the governor of C {ivs} P·
Berzem3 and Joseph the Carizmian presumed to defend his fortress s.....„--a
against the powers of the East. XVhen he was produced a captive
in the royal tent, the sultam, instead of praismg his valour, severely
reproached his obstinate folly3 and the insolent replies of the rebel
provoked a sentence, that he ihonld be fastened to four stakes and
left to expire in that painful situation. At this command the des-

R'Iusulman3 his voice and stature commanded the reverence of man-
kind 3 his face was ssiaded with long whiskers 3 and his ample turban
was fashioned in the shape of a crown. The remains of the sultan

were depofited in the tomb of the Seljukian dynasty3 and the paffenger
