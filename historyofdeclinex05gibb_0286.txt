der this general divifion, I ssiall proceed to unfold these memorable
transactions; dispatching with brevity the remote and less interesting
conquests of the East, and reserving a fuller narrative for those do-
mestic countries, which had been included within the pale of the
Roman empire. Yet I must excuse my own defeets by a just com-
plaint of the blindness and insufficiency of my guides. The Greeks,
so loquacious in controversy, have not been anxious to celebrate
the triumphs of their enemies¹⁰. After a century of ignorance, the
first annals of the Musulmans were collected in a great measure from
the voice of tradition ¹¹. Among the numerous productions of Arabic

and Perfian literature ¹², our interpreters have selected the imperfect

¹⁰ For the vii‘h and νὶίὶῑὴ century, we have
scarcely any original evidence of the Byzan-
tine historians, except the Chronieles of'rheo-
phanes (Theophanis Confefforis Chronogra-
phia, Gr. et Lat. cum notis Jacobi Goar.
Paris, 1655, in folio), · and the Abridge—
ment os Nicephorus (Nicephori patriarchae,
C. P. Breviarium Histoiicum‚ Gr et Lat.
l' aris ‚‚1648 in folio), who both lived' in the
beginningofthe im century (see Hanckius de
Scriptor. Byzant. p.200-246.). Their con·
temporary l'hotius does not seem to be more
opulent. After praifing the style of Nice-
phorus, he adds, Ka· ἃλας πολλᾶς tri τοι ’,τρο
αι’τᾶ απεκρυπτομενος τῃὲε τῆς ι’ῗοριας τη συνγραιφν,
and only complains of his extreme brevity
(Phor. Bibliot. cod. lxvi. p. 100.). Some
additions may be gleaned frorn the more re-
cent histor-ies of cedrenus and Zonaras of the
ali.n century.

¹¹ Tabari, or Al Tabari, a native os Ta-
borestan, a famous Imam of Bagdnd, and the
Livy of the Arabiam, finiffhed his general
history in the year of the Hegira 30² (Α. D.
914). At the requei} of his friends, he rt·-

duced a work of 30‚000 lheets to a more rea-
sonable size. But his Arabic original is known
only by the Persian and Turkissi verfions.
The Saracenic history of Ebn Amisi, or El-
macin, is said to be an abrio'gment of the
great Tabari (Ockley’s Hist. ofthe Saracens,
vol. ii. preface p. xxxix. and, list of authors,
d’Herbelot, p.s66. 870. ¹0¹4·)·

deaux (Life of Mahomet, p. 179—189.),
Ockley (at the end of his second volume),
and Petit de la Croix (Hist. de Gengiscan.
p. 525-550.)‚ we find in the Bibliotheque
Orientale Tarikh, a catalogue of two or three
hundred histories or chronicles of the East, of
which not more than three or four are older
than Tabari. A lively Iketch of Oriental
literature is given by Reilkc (in his Prodidag-
mata ad Hagji Chalifae librum memorialem
ad calcem Abulfedae Tabulae Syriae, Lipfiae,
1766); but his projeft and the French ver-
11οη of Petit de ln Croix (Hist. dc 'I'imur Bec.
tom.i. prefate. p. xlv.) have fallen to the
ground.
