From this mixture, which produced a thick smoke and a loud ex-
plosion, proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame, which not only rose
in perpendicular astent, but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in
-descent or lateral progress ; instead of being extinguished, it was
nourished and quickened, by the element of water ; and sand, urine,
or vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this
powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the Greeks, the
liquid, or the maritime, fire. For the annoyance of the enemy, it was
employed with equal effect, by sea and land, in battles or in fieges.
It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers, or launched
in red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in arrows and javelins,
twisted round with flax and tow, which had deeply imbibed the
inflammable oil: sometimes it was depofited in fire-ffiips, the vic-
tims and instruments of a more ample revenge, and was'most com-
monly blown through long tubes of copper, which were planted on

Sea. According to Pliny (Hist. Natur. ii.
109.)‚ it was subservient to‘ the revenge of

Medea, and iu either etymology the ελαιω
