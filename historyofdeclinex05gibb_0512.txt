THE DECLINE AND FALL

The invention of the Greek fire did not, like that of gunpowder,

¹ produce a total revolution in the art of war. To these liquid com-

bustibles‚ the city and empire of Constantine owed their deliverance3
and they were employed in fieges and sea-fights with terrible effe&-
But they were either less improved, or less susceptible of improve-
ment: the engines of antiquity, the catapultae, balistae, and batter-
ing-rams, were still of most frequent and powerful use in the attack
and defence of fortifications'; nor was the decision of battles reduced to
the quick and heavyfire of a line of infantry, whom it vvere fruitless
to prote& with armour against a similar fire of their enemies. Steel
and iron were still the common instrumente, of destruction and safety3
and the helmets, cuiraffes, and ffiields, of the tenth century did not,
either in form or substance, effentially differ from those which had
covered the companions of Alexander or Achilles ⁷⁷. But instead of
accustorning the modern Greeks, like the legionaries of old, to the
constant and easy use of this salutary weight; their armour was
laid aside in light chariots, which followed the march, till, on the
approach of an enemy, they resumed with haste and reluctance the
unusual incumbrance. Their offenfive weapons confisted of swords,
battle-axes, and spears3 but the Macedonian pike was ffiortened a
fourth of its length, and reduced to the more convenient measure of
twelve cuhits or feet. The ssiarpness of the Scythian and Arabiarr
arrows had been severely felt3 and the emperors larnent the decay
of archery as a cause of the public misfortunes, and recommend, as
an advice, and a command, that the military youth, till the age of
forty‚ ssiould affiduoussy praetise the exercise of the bow ⁷⁸. The
