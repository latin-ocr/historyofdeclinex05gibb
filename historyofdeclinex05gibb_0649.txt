OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

refist the impcnding attack of the king of Sicily. His prop'necy
was soon verified ε the death of Palaeologus devolved the command
on several ehiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike defective in military
talento 3 the Greeks were oppreffed by land and sea 3 and a captive
remnant that escapcd the swords of the Normans and Sar-aceris, ab-
jured all future hostility against the person or dominions of their
conqueror ¹²². Yet the king of Sicily csteemed the courage and con-
stancy of Mannel, who had landed a second army on the Italian
shore : hc rcspcffiffully addreffed the new Justinian3 solicited a peace
or truce of thirty years, accepted as a gift, the regal title3 and ac-
knowledged himself the military vaffal of the Roman empire¹²³.
The Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this {hadow of dominion, with-
out expecting, perhaps without destring‚ the service of a Norman
army ; and the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any hosti-
lities between Sicilyxand Constantinople. About the end of that
period, the throne of hffanuel was» usurped by an inhuman tyrant,
who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and mankind: the
sword of William the second, the grandson of Roger, was drawn by
a fugitive of the Comncnian race3 and the subjeets of Andronicus
might salute the strangers as friends, fince they detested their sove-

the praise of the king of Sicily, Cinnamus
(1, iv. c. 13. p. 97, 98.) is much warmer and
copious than Fakaudus (p. 268. 270.). But
the Greek is fond of description, and the
Latin histor-ian is not fond of William the
Bad.

namus(1.iv. c. ¹5· p. 101, 102), and Ni-
cetas (Lii- c. 8.). It is difficul: to affirm,

whether these Greeks deceived themselvoe,
or the public, in these flatrering porzraias ef
the grandeur of the empire.
