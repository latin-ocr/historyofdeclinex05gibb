five hundred Ruffians were put to the sword3 and the sons of the ι-γ-ι

Bulgarian king were rescued from an ignominious prison, and in-
vested with a nominal diadem. After these repeated loffes, Swatossaus
retired to the strong post of Dristra, on the banks of theDanube,
and was pursued by an enemy who alternately employed the arms of
celerity and delay. The Byzantine gallies ascended the river3 the
legions completed a line of circumvallation 3 and the Ruffian prince

was surprised and oppreffed by the neighbouring tribes, with whom

like Camillus or Marius, the saviours of ancient Rome. But the
merit of the vietory was attributed by the pious emperor to the
mother of *God3 and the image of the Virgin Mai-y, with the
divine infant in her arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned
