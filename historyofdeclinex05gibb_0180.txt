hair, which falls each year and is renewed, is coarsely manufaetured
into the garments‚ the furniture, and the tents, of the Bedoweens.

they remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of Yemen,
or the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the
dangerous licence of visiting the banks of the Nile, and the villages
of Syria and Palestinc. The life of a wandering Arab is a life of
danger and distress; and though sometimes, by rapine or exchange,

their brethren of the desert 3 and the Bedoweens derived from their
useful intercourse, some supply of their wants, and some rudiments of
art and knowledge. Among the forty-two citics of Arabia ¹⁴, enu-
