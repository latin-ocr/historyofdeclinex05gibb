On the intelligence of this rapid success, the applause of Musa conquest of

degenerated into envy; and he began, not to complain, but to fear,
that Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue„ At the head of ten
thousand Arabs and eight thousand Africam, he paffed over in per-
son from Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions were the
noblest of the Koreilh3 his eldest son was left in the command of
Africa3 the three younger brethren were of an age and spirit to
second the boldest enterprises'of their father. At his landing in
Algezire, he was respectfully entertained by count Julian, who
stifled his inward remorse‚ and testified‚ both in words and actions,
that the vietory of the Arabs had not impaired his attachment to
their cause. Some enemies yet remained for the sword of Musa.
The tardy repentance of the Goths had compared their own num-
bers and those of the invader33 the cities from which the march of
Tarik had declined, confidered themselves as impregnable3 and the
bravest patriots defended the fortifications of Seville and Merida.
They were succeffively besieged and reduced by the labour of Musa,
who transported his camp from the Boetis to the 'Anas, from the
Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When he beheld the works of Ro-
man magnificence, the bridge, the aquedu&s‚ the triumphal arches,
and the theatre, of the ancient metropolis of Lusitania, “ 1 should
“ imagine‚” said he to his four companionS, “ that the human race
“ must have united their art and power in the foundation of this
“ city: happy is the man who shall become its master !’' He aspired
to that happiness, but the Emeritam· sustained on this occasion the
honour of their descent from the veteran legionaries of Augustus ¹³³.
