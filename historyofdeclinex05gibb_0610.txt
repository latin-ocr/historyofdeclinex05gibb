598 THE DECLINE AND FALL

C {Vf- P· the past and future conquests of the Normans. By whatever hands

office they had been Usul‘ped‚ the provinces of Apulia and Calabria were

Normans. Peter: the grant and the acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of

the pontiff and the adventurers. They promised to support each other
with spiritual and temporal arms3 a tribute or quit-rent of twelve·
pence was afterwards stipulated for every plough-land; and smee

above seven hundred years a fief of the Holy See ³⁶.

 

-Birth and
charafter of
Robert Gui-

The pedigree of Robert Guiscard³⁷ is varioussy deduced from the

peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peafiants‚ by the
stares· D. pride and ignorance of a Grecian princess ³²³ 3 fromnthe dukes, by the
¹⁰²0''¹035· ignorance and flattery of the Italian subje&s ³⁹. His genuine descent
may be ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility ⁴⁰.
He sprang from a race of valvqffbrs or bannerets‚ of the diocese of

³⁶ The origin and nature of the papal in- τυχης onomag- Anna Comnena was born in

vestitures are ably discuffed by Giannone
(Istoria Civile di Napoli, tom. ii. p. 37-49.
57—66.) as a lawyer and antiquarian. Yet

he vainly strives to reconcile the duties of

patriot and catholic, adopts an empty dis-
tine‘tion of “ Ecclesia Romana non dedit sed
¹‘ accepit,” and shrinks from an honest but
dangerous confession of the truth.

³⁹ The birth, eharaffler, and first aetions

of Robert Guiscard, may be found in Jeffrey
Malaterra (l. i. c. 3, 4. 11. 16, 17, 18. 38,
39, 40), William Appulus (1. ii. p. 260-
262.), William Gemeticenfis or ofJumieges
(1. xi. c. 30. p. 663, 664. edit. Cambden),
and Anna Comnena (Alexiad, 1. i. p. 23—
27. l. vi. p. 165, 166.)‚ with the annota-
tions ofDucange (Not. in Alexiad. p. 230—
232. 3zo.)‚ who has swept all the French
and Latin chronicles for supplemental intelli-
gence-

the purple3 yet her father was no more than
a private though illustrioris subject, who
raised himself to the empire.
³⁹ Giaunone (tom. ii. p. 2.) forgets all
his original authors, and rests this princely
descent on the credit ofInveges, an Augustine
monk of Palermo in the last century. They
continue the succeffion of dukes from Rollo
to William 11. the Bastard or conqueror,
whom they hold (communemente fi tiene) to
be the father of Tancred of Hauteville: a
most strange and stupendous blunder! The
sons' of Tancred fought in Appulia, before
WilliamII. was three years old (A.D. 1037).
⁴⁰ The judgment of Ducange is just and
moderate: Certe humilis fuit ac tenuis Ro-
berti familia, fi ducalem et regium speeie-
mus apicem, ad quem postea pervenit3 quae
honesta tamen et praeter nobilium vulgarium
statum et conditionem illustris habita est,
‘¹ quae nec humi reperet nec altum quid tu·
'¹ meret” (Wilhelm. Malmlbur. de Gestis
Anglorum, l. iii. p. 107. Not. ad Alexiad.
p. 230.).
