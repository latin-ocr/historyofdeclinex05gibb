THE DECLINE AND FALL

observed, that in a light of precaution, all conquest must be ineffec-·
tual, unless it could be universal3 since the encreasmg circle must

be involved in a larger sphere of hostility¹¹⁵.

The subjugation of
Germany withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the conti-
nent or issands of scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe, and
awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives. The fiereest
of the Saxon id'olaters escaped from the Christian tyrant to their bre-
thren of the north3 the Ocean and Mediterranean were covered with
their pyratical fleets ; and Charlernagne beheld with a figh the de-
struetive progress of the Normans, who, in less than seventy years,
precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.

Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive constitution,
the titles of emperor and Augustus were conferred on Charlemagne
for the term of his life3 and his succeffors, on each vacancy, must
have ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election. But the as-
sociation of his son Levvis the Pious afferts the independent right of
monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems on this occasion to
have foreseen and prevented the latent claims of the clergy. The
royal youth was commanded to take the crown from the altar, and
with his own hands to place it on his head, as a gift which he held

mitted from father to son in a lineal descent of four generations 3
and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honour of
