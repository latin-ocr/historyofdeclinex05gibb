laeologus, a patrician‚ vietorious in the Oriental wars, and a numerous
garrison of Albanians and Macedonians, who, in every age, have
maintained the chara&er of soldiers. In the prosecution of his' en-
terprise, the courage of Guiseard was affailed by every form of dan-

court. The first day's aftion was not disadvantageous to Bohemond,
a beardless youth ⁶⁸, who led the naval powers of his father. All
