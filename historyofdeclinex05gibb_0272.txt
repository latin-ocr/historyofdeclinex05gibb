THE DECLINE AND FALL

the consequences of his rebellion. “ Do you think,'’ replied he,
“l to terrify me with death ?'’ And, during the short respite of a
night, he prepared with calrn and solemn resignation to encounter
his fate. He checked the lamentations of his fister Fatima, who de-
plored the impending ruin of his house. “ Our trust‚'’ said Hosein,
