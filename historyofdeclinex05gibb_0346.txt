The Alexan-
drian library.

THE DECLINE AND FALL

ancl fortificationis of Alexandria were twice occupied by a fleet and , ’

army of Romans. They were twice expelled by the valour of
Amrou, who was recalled by the domestic peril from the distant wars
of Tripoli and Nubia. But the facility of the attempt, the repeti-
tion of the insult, and the obstinaey of the resistance‚ provoked him
to swear, that if a third time he drove the infidels into the sea, he
would render Alexandria as accessible on all fides as the house of a
prostitute. Faithful to his promise, he dismantled several parts of
the walis and towers‚ but the people was spared in the'chastisement
of the city, and the mosch of rMercy was erected on the spot where
the vidiorious general had stopped the fury of his troops.

I should deceive the expectation of the reader, if I paffed in silence
the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described by the 'learned
Abulpharagius. The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal
than that of his brethren‚ and in his leisure hours, the Arabian chief

was pleased with the conversation of John, the last disciple of Arn-
monius, and who derived the surname of Philoponus, from his labo-
rious studies of grammar and philosophy¹¹⁵. Emboldened by this
familiar intercourse, Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inesti-
mable in his opinion, contemptible in that of the Barbarians3 the
royal library, which alone, among the spoils of Alexandria, had
not been appropriated by the vifit and the seal of the conqueror.
Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his
rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest obje& without the
consent of the caliph3 and the well-known answer of Omar was in-
spired by the ignorance of a fanatic. “ If thesewritings of the
