Latin church, the nations of the x*Vest, who stretched beyond the ezr κ-«ν--ο

knowledge to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. The vast body had
been inspired and united by the soul of Charlemagne ; but the divi-
sion and degeneracy of his race soon annihilated the Imperial power,
which would have rivalled the Caesars of Byzantium, and revengcd
the indignities of the Christian name. The enemies no longer fear-
ed, nor could the subjeCls any longer trust, the application of a
*public revenue, the labours of trade and manufaCmres in the mili-
tary service, the mutual aid of provinces and armies, and the naval
squadrons which were regularly stationed from the mouth of the
Elbe to that of the Tyber. In the beginning of the tenth century0
the family of Charlemagne had almost disappeared3 his monarchy
was broken into many hostile and independent states ; the regal title
was assumed by the most ambitious chiefs ; their revolt was imitated
in a long subordination of anarchy and discord, and the nobles of
every province disobeyed their sovereign, oppreffed their vaffals, and
exercised perpetual hostilities against their equals and neighbours‚
Their private wars, which overturned the fabric of government, fo-
mented the martial spirit of the nation. In the system of modern
Europe, the power of the sword is poffeffed, at least in fact, by five
or six mighty potentates; their operations are conducted on a distant

frontier, by an order of men who devote their lives to the study and
prafiice of the military art z the rest of the country and community

enjoys in the midst of war the tranquillity of peace, and is only
made senfible of the change by the aggravation or decrease of the
public taxes. In the disorders of the tenth and eleventh centuries‚
every peasant was a soldier, and every village a fortification3 each
wood or valley was a scene of murder and rapine3 and the lords of
each castle were compelled to affume the character of princes and
