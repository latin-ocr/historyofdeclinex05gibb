c H A Ρ. FTER pursuing above fix hundred years the fleeting Caesars
ς-ὲ-ι of Constantinople and Germany, I now descend, in the reign

of Heraclius, on the eastern borders of the Greek monarchy. While
the state was exhausted by the Perfian war, and the church was dis·
tradied by the Nestorian 'and Monophyfite scits, Mahomet, with
the sword in one hand and the koran in the other, ereeted his throne

on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome. The genius of the Ara-
bian prophet, the manners of his nation, and the spirit of his reli-
gion, involve the cau-ses of the decline and fall of the Eastern em-
pire ; and our eyes are curioussy intent on one of the most memo-
rable revolufions, which have impreffed a new and lasting character
on the nations of the globe ¹.

¹ As in this aad the following chapter 1 terpreters, who have transfused their science
shall display much Arabio learning, 1 must into theLatin‚French,and English languages.
profess my total ignorance of the Oriental Their colleffions, verfions, and histories, 1
tongues, and my gratitude to the learned in- shall occafionally notice.
