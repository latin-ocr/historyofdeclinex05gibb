rustic songs is long since forgotten3 and that the fragments of a

among the tribes of Scythia, they are distinguished by the Greeks
under the proper and peculiar name of Tarks, as the descendants of
that mighty people who had conquered and reigned from China to

the Volga. The Pannonian colony preserved a correspondence of

opinion to a reverend abbot; but he more
gravely decided, that Gog and Magog were
the spiritual persecutors os the church; fince
Gog signifies the roof, the pride of the He-

’Β The two national authors, from whom
I have derived the most assistance, are George
Pray (Differtationes ad Annales veterum Hun-
garorum, διε. Vindobonae, 1775, in folio),
and Stephen Katona (Hist. Critica Ducum et
Regum Hungariae stirpis Arpadianae, Paessini,
mys—1781, 5vols. in offlam). The first
embraces a large and often conjenural space:
the latter, by hi> learning, judgmenr, and
perspicuity, deserves the name of a critical
historiari.

¹⁹ The author of this C‘nronicle is styled
the notary of king Bela. Katona has affigned
him to the xiifl' century, and defends his
charae'ter against the hypercriticism of Pray.
This rude annalist must have transcribed some
hissorical records‚ fince he could affirm with
dignity, rejeftis salfis fabulis rusticorum, et gar-
rulo cantu joculatorum. In the xv‘h century,
these fibles were colleEied by Thurotzius,
and embellished by the Italian Bonfinius. See
the Preliminary Discoursein the Hist. Cxixiea
Ducum, p. 7—33.

perio, c. 3, 4. 13· 38—42. Katona hae
nicely fixed the composition of this work to
the years 949, 950, 93¹· (p. 4—7.). The
critical historian (p. 34—107.) endeavours to
prore :hc existence, and to relate the actions,
of a first duke Almus, the father of Arpad,
who is tacitly rcjec‘ted by Constantine.
