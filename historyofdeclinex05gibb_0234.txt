THE DECLINE AND FALL

C 1;1 A Ρ· at least in their imperfetst saith. In the first months of his reign, he

h--sr'w praeiised the lessbns of holy warfare, and displayed his white banner

before the gates of Medina: the martial apos'de fought in person at
nine battlcs or fieges ¹²³ ; and fifty cntcrprises of war were atchieved
in ten years by himself or his licutenants. The Arab continued to
unite the profeffions of ιι merchant and a robbcr; and his petty ex·-
curs10ns for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensxbly prc-
pared his troops for the conquest of Arabia. The distribution of the
spoil was regulated by a divine law ¹²⁶: the whole was faithfully eol-
leeted in one common mass: a fifth of the gold and silver, the pri-
soner-s and cattle, the movcables and immovcables, was reserved by
the prophet for pious and charitable uses; the remainder was shared
in adequate portione by the soldicrs who had obtained the vietory
or guarded the camp: the rewards of the ssain devolved to their
widows and orphans; and the encrease of cavalry was eneouraged
'by the allotment of a double {hare to the horse and to the man.
From all fides the roving Arabs were allured to the standard of reli-
gion and plunder: the apostle sanCtified the licence of embracing the
'female captives as their wives or concubines ; and the enjoyment of
wealth'and beauty was a feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared
for the valiant martyrs of the faith. “ The sword,” says Mahomet,

“ is the key of heaven and of hell: a drop of blood shed in the
‘⁶ cause of God, a night spent in arms, is of more avail than two
“ months of fasting or prayer: whosocver falls in battle, his fins are
“ forgiven: at the day of judgmcnt his wounds shall be resplendent
