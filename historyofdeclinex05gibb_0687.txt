OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 675

Since the first conquests of the caliphs‚ the establishment of the C iflet. P,

Turks in Anatolia or Asia Minor was the most deplorable loss which u-se--ae
the church and empire had sustained. By the propagatim] of the ἓξὲξ ἵζ’

Mossem faith, Soliman desei-ved the name of Gazi, a holy cham- fz‘z‘ssnfff

pion3 and his new kingdom, of the Romans, or of Roum, was added
to the tables of Oriental geography. It is described as extending
from the Euphrates to Constantinopie, from the Black Sea to the
confines of Syria ; pregnant with mines of fiiver and iron, of allum
and copper, fruitful in corn and wine, and produeiive of cattle and
excellent horses⁵². The wealth of Lydia, the arts of the Greeks,
the splendour of the Augustan age, existed only in books and ruins,
which were equally obscure in the eyes of the Scythian conqueror&
Yet, in the present decay‚ Anatolia still contains some wealthy and
populous cities ς and, under the Byzantine empire, they were far
more flourishing in numbers, fize, and opulence. By the choice of
the sultan, Nice, the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for his
palace and fortress: the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum was
planted one hundred miles from Constantinople3 and the divinity of
Christ was denied *and derided in the same temple in which it had
been pronounced by the first general synod of the Catholics. The
unity of God, and the miffion of Mahomet, were preached in the
moschs; the Arabian learning was taught in the schools; the Cadhis
judged according to the law of the Koran3 the Turkish manners
and language prevailed in the cities ; and Turkman camps were
scattered over the plains and mountains of Anatolia. On the hard
conditions of tribute and servitude, the Greek Christians might en-
joy the exercise of their religi0n; but their most holy churches were
profaned 3 their priests and bishops were insulted ⁵³5 they were com-

pelled
