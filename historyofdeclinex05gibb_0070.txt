66 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Cxffvfilp· with the Latius, Alexius was patient and a1·:tful his discerning eye
u--v—-ae pervaded the new system of an unknown world, and 1 shall here-
after describe the superior policy with which he balanced the interests
'and passions of the champions of the first crusade. In a long reign
of thirty· -seven years, he subdued and pardoncd the envy of his

tongue, his pen, and his sword. His character was degraded by th'e
superstition of the Greeks; and the same inconsistent principle of
human nature enjoined the emperor to found an hospital for the
poor and infirm, and to direct the execution of an herede, who was
