years; and their noblest title is the free choice of a people, whom
they had redeemed from ssavery.

was incompatible with the zeal and ambition of the popes z their Ro-
mans were not addicted‚ like the inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent

and placid labours of agriculture 3 and the Barbarians of Italy, though
softened by the climate, were far below the Grecian states in the
institutions of public and private life. A memorable example of
