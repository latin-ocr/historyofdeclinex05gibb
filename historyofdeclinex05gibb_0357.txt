trepid warriors3 and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was
surm-ised, affausted, overturncd, by new squadrons of the faithful,
who, to the eye of fanaticism, might appear as a band of angels
descending from the fl<y- The praefeet himself was ssain by the
hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who fought revenge and death, was
surrounded and made prisoner3 and the fugitives involved in their
disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the sabres
and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred and fifty
miles to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is watered by a
running stream, and ffiaded by a grove of juniper-tree53 and, in the
ruins of a triumphal arch, a portiCO, and three temples of the Co—
rinthian order, curiosity may yet admire the magnificence of the
Romans ¹⁴³. After the fall of this opulent city, the provincials and
Barbarians implored on all fides the mercy of the conqueror. His
vanity or his zeal might be flattered by offers of tribut'e or profes-
fions of faith: but his losses, his fatigues, and the progress of an
epidemical disease, prevented a solid establissiment3 and the Sara-
cens, after a campaign of fifteen months, retreated to the confines
of Egypt, with the captives and the wealth of their African expe-
dition. The caliph’s fifth was granted to a favourite, on the nomi-

state was doubly injured by this fallacious transaction, if each foot-
soldier had shared one thousand, and each horseman three thousand,
pieces‚ in the real division of the plunder. The author of the death
