reluctance to the partition of the empire. The senate was sum-
moned to the palace to ratify or attest the afforciation of Heracleonas,
the son of Martina: the impolition of the diadem was consecrated
by the prayer and blessing of the patriarch3 the senators aud patri-
cians adored the majesty of the great emperor and the pai-mers of
his reign3 and as soon as the doors were thrown open, they were
hailed by the tumultuary but important voice of the soldiers. After
an interval of five months, the pompous ceremoni'es which formed
the ess'ence of the Byzantine state were celebrated 'in the cathedral
and the hippodrome: the concord of the royal brothers was affeci:-
edly displayed by the younger leaning on the arm of the elder3 and
the name of Martina was mingled in the reluctant or venal accla-
mations of the people. Heraclius survived this affociation about
two years ιγ his last testament deelared his two sons the equal heirs
of the Eastern empire, and commanded them to honour his widow
Martina as their mother and their sovereign.

attributes of royalty‚ she was checked by a firm, though respectful,
opposltion3 and the dying embers of freedom were kindled by the

voice of a citizen, “ we reverence the mother of our princes3 but
“ to those princes alone our obedience is due3 and Constantine, the
‘⁵ elder emperor, is of an ‘age to sustain, in his own hands, the
‘⁶ weight of the sceptre. Your sex is excluded' by nature from the
“ toils of government. How could you combat, how could you
“ anlwer, the Barbarians, who, with hostile or friendly intentions,
“ may approach the royal city? May heaven avert from the Ro-
“ man republic this national disgrace, which would· provoke the
