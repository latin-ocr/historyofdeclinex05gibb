Maffoud, the son and successor of Mahmud, had too long neglected
the advice of his wisest Omrahs. “ Your enemies‚'’ they repeatedly
urged, “ were in their origin a swarm of ants ; they are now little

of truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his lieu-
tenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans, who
