From the paths of blood, and such is the history of nations, Ι grimharae-

cannot refuse to turn afide to gather some flowers of science or virtue.
The name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in the East:

his subjec’cs enjoyed the bleffings of prosperity and peace3 his vices
were concealed by the' veil ‘of religion ; and two familiar examples
will testify his justice and magnanimity. Ι. As he sat in the Divan,
an unhappy subje& bowed before the throne to accuse the insolence
of a Turkish soldier who had driven him from his house and bed.
“ Suspend your clamours,” said Mahmud 3 “ inform me of his next
‘⁶ vifit, and ourself in person will judge and punish the offender.’'
The sultan followed his guide, invested the house with his guards,
*and extinguiihing the torches‚ pronounced the death of the criminal,
who had been seized in the a& of rapine and adultery. After the
execution of his sentence, the lights were rekindled, Mahmud fell
prostrate in prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some
homely fare, which he devoured with the voraciousness of hunger.
The poor man, whose injury he had avenged, was unable to sup-
press his astonishment and curiofity3 and the courteous monarch
condescended to explain the motives of this singular behaviour. “ I
“ had reason to suspect that none except one of my sons could dare
“ to perpetrate such an outrage3 and I extinguissied the lights, that
“ my justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer was a
“ thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender3 and so painful was
“ my anxiety, that I had pafl'ed three days without food finee the
“ first moment of your complaint.'' Π. The sultan of Gazna had
declared war against the dynasty of the Bowides‚ the sovereigns of
the western Persia: he was disarmed by an epistle of the sultana
mother, and delayed his invasion till the manhood of her son⁸.
