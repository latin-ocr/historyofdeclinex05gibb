munity. The rumour of this domestic revolution excited a tumult cm

in the city3 but Porphyrogenitus alone, the true and lawful empe.
ror, was the objetff't of the public care3 and the sons of Lecapenus
were taught, by tardy experience, that they had atchieved a guilty
and perilous enterprise for the benefit of their rival. Their sister
Helena, the wife of Constantine, revealed, or supposed, their trea-
cherous defign of afl'affinating her hulband at the royal banquet. His
loyal adherents were alarmed ; and the two usurpers were prevented,
seized, degraded from the purple, and embarked for the same. issand
and monastery where their father had been so lately confined. Old
Romanus met thern on the beach with a sarcastic smile, and, after
a just reproaeh of their folly and ingrafflude, presented his Imperial
colleagues with an equal share of his water and vegetable diet. ln
the fortieth year of his reign, Constantine the seventh obtained the pos-
seffion of the Easteru world, which he ruled‚ or seemed to rule, near fif-
teen years. But he was devoid of that energy of character which could
emerge into a lise ofatffion and glory; and the studies which had amused
and dignified his leisure, were incompatible with the serious duties
of a sovereign. The emperor negleffi'ted the practice, to instruct his

son Romanus in the theory, of government: while he indulged the
habits of intemperance and ssoth‚ he dropt the reins of the admi-

nistration into the hands of Helena his wife3 and, in the shifting
scene of her favour and caprice, each minister was regretted in the·
promotion of a more worthless successor. Yet the birth 'and mis-
fortunes of Constantine had endem-ed him to the Greeks; they ex-
cused his failings3 they respected his learning, his innocence, and
scharim, his love of justice3 and ,the ceremony of his funeral was·
mourned with the unfeigned tears of his subjects. The body, ac-
cording to ancient custorn, lay in state in the vestibule of the palace 3
and the civil and military efficers, the patriciam, the senate, and the
