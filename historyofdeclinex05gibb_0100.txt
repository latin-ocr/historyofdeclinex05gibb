the common ruin ; and his divine resemblance became the ssave and
trophy of the infidels. After a servitude of three hundred years, the
Palladium was yielded to the devotion of Constantinople, for a ran-

hundred Musulamos, and a perpetual truce for the territory of ⁴
Edeffa ¹⁶. In this season of distress and dismay, the eloquence of the
monks was exercised in the defence of images 3 and they attempted
to prove, that the sm and schism of the greatest part of the Orientals
had forfeited the favour, and annihilated the virtue, of these precious
symbOIS. But they were now opposed by'the murmurs of many
sunple or rational Christiane, who appealed to the evidence of texts,
of facts, and of the primitive times, and secretly defired the reforma-
tion of the church. As the worship of images had never been esta-
blished by any general or positive law, its progress in the Eastern
empire had been retarded, or accelerated‚ by the differences of men
and manners, the local degrees of refinement, and the personal cha-
racters of the bishops. The splendid devotion was fondly cherished
by the levity of the capital, and the inventive genius of the Byzantine
ciergy; while the rude and remote districts oL Afia were strangers
to this innovation of sacred luxury. Many large congregations of
Gnosties and Arians maintained, after their converfion, the fimple
worship which had preceded their separati0n3 and the Armenians,
