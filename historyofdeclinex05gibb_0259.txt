excuse may be drawn from his fidelity to Cadijah. During the C H A Ρ·

twenty-four years of their marriage, her youthful husband abstained
from the right of polygamy‚ and the pride or tenderness of the ve-
nerable matron was never insulted by the society of a rival. After
her death, he placed her in the rank of the four perfect women, with-
the slster of Moses, the mother of Jesus, and Fatima‚ the best be·-
loved of his daughters. “ XVas she not old ?''’ said Ayesha‚ with the
insolence of a blooming beauty; “ has not God given you a better
“ in her place ?'' “ No, by G0d‚” said Mahomet, with an effusior]
of honest gratitude, “ there never can be a better! She believed
‘⁶ in me, when men defpised me: she relieved my wants, when Ι
“ was poor and persecuted by the world ¹⁶⁵.”

In the largest indulgence of polygamy, the founder of a religion
and empire might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous poste-
rity and a lineal succeffion. The hopes of Mahomet were fatally
disappointed. Trhe virgin Ayesha, and his ten widows of mature
age and approved fertility‚ were barren in his potent embraces.
The four sons of Cadijah died in their infancy. Mary, his Egyptian
concubine, was endeared to him by the birth of Ibrahim. At the
end of fifteen months the prophet wept over his grave3 but he sus-
tained with firmness the raillery of his enemies‚ and checked the
adulation or credulity of the Mossems‚ by the affurance that an
eclipse of the sun was not occasioned by the death of the infant.
Cadijah had likewise given him four daughters, who were married
