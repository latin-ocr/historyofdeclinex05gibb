the second, emperor of the W'est3 the younger became the wife cf m
W olodomir, great duke and apostle of Russia, and, by the marriage of Qassgff'

her grand-daughter with Henry the first, king of France, the blood of
the Macedonians, and perhaps of the Arsacides, still flows in the veins
of the Bourbon line. After the death of her husband, the cmpress
aspired to reign in the name of her sonS, the elder of whom was
five, and the younger only two, years of age; but {he soon felt
the instability of a throne, which was supported by a female who
could not be esteemed, and two infants who could not be feared.
Theophano looked around for a protector, and threw herself into
the arms of the bravest soldier; her heart was capacious; but the
deformity of the new favourite rendered it more than probable that
interest was the motive and excuse of her love. Nicephorus Phocas
united, in the popular opinion, the double merit of an hero and a
saint. In the former charad‘oer, his qualifications were genuine and
splendid: the descendant of a race, illustrious by their military ex·
ploits, he had displayed, in every station and in every province, the
courage of a soldier and the conduct of a chief; and Nicephorus
was crowned with recent laurels, from the important conquest of
the isse of Crete. His religion was of a more ambiguous cast ; and
his haircloth, his fasts, his pious idiom, and his wish to retire from
the business of the world, were a convenient mask for his dark and
. dangerous ambition. Yet he imposed on an holy patriarch, by
whose influence, and by a decree of the senate, he was entrusted,
during the minority of the young princes, with the absolute and
independent command of the Oriental armies. As soon as he had
secured the leaders and the troops, he boldly marched to Constanti-
nople, trampled on his enemies, avowed his correspondence with the
cmpress, and, without degrading her sons, assumed with the title of

Augustus, the pre-eminence of rank and the plenitude of power.
