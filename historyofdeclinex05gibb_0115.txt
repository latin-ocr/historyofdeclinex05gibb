servitude, from the persecution of Leo the Isaurian. By the Caesars,
the triumphs of the consuls had been annihilated: in the decline and
fall of the„ empire, the god Terminus, the sacred boundary, had in-
senfibly receded from the ocean, the Rhine, the Danube, and the
Euphrates; and Rome was reduced to her ancient territory from
Viterbo to Terracina, and from Narni to the mouth of the Tyber⁴².
