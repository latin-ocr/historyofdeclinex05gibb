bered by the subjectS of a fertile and industrious province. Along

the shores of the Perfian gulf, of the ocean, and even of the Red Sea,
the Ithophagi ⁹, or fiffi-eaters‚ continued to wander in quest of their
precarious food. In this primitive and abjeec state, which ill de-
serves the name of society, the human brute, without arts or laws,
almost without sense or language, is poorly distinguished from the
rest of the animal creation. Generations and ages might roll away
in filent oblivion, and the helpless savage was restrained from mul-
tiplying his race, by the wants and pursuits which confined his exist-
ence to the narrow margin of the sea-coast. But in an early period
of antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this
scene of misery3 and as the naked wilderncss could not maintain a

people of hunters‚ they rose at once to the more secure and plentiful

condition of the pastoral life. The same life is uniformly pursued
by the roving tribes of the desert, and in the portrait of the modern
Bedoweens, we may trace the features of their ancestors¹⁰, who, in

the age of Moses οι· Mahomet, dwelt under fimilar tents, and con-
duded their horses, and camels, and sheep, to the same springs and
the same pastures. Our toil is leffened, and our wealth is encreased,

by our dominion over the usefulanima153 and the Arabian shep-
