OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.

chamber, intoxicated with flattery and wine, and forgctful that his

example had made every subjc& ambidous, and that every ambitibus

subject was his secret enemy. Some bold conspirators introduced
themselves in the disorder of the feast3 and the ssumbering monarch
was stuprised, bound, bhnded, and deposed, before he was senfible
of his danger. Yet t'ne traitors were deprived of their reward3 and
the free voice of the senate and people promoted Artemius from the
office of secretary to that of emperor: he assumed thc title of Ana-
stasius the second, and displayed in a short aud troubled reign the
virtues both of peace and war. But, after the extin&ion of the
Imperial line, the rule of obedience was violated‚ and every change

mitted in his turn to the superior ascendant of Leo, the general and
emperor of the Oriental troops. His two predeceffors were per-
mitted to embrace the ecclefiastical profeffion: the restless impatience
of Anastasius tempted him to risk and to lose his life in a treason-
able enterprise3 but the last days of Theodofius were honourable and
secure. The single sublime word “ HEALTH‚'' which he inscribed
on his tomb, expresses the confidence of philosophy or religion3
and the fame of his miracles was long preserved among the people
of Ephesus. This convenient shelter of the church might some-
times impose a leffon of clemeucy3 but it may be questioned whe-
ther it is for the public interest to diminish the perils of unsuccessful
ambition.

I have dwelt on the fall of a tyrant3 I ssiall briefly represent the
founder of a new dynasty, who is known to posterity by the in-
vectivesxof his enemies‚ and whose public and private life is in·-
volved in the ecclefiastical story of the iconoclasts. Yet in spite of
