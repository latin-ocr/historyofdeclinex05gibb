Italy, their efforts were feeble and adverse ; and the Greeks resisted
or eluded the forces of Germany, which descended from the Alps

under the Imperial standard of the Othos. The first and greatest

of those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the slege of
Bari: the second, after the loss of his stoutest bishops and barons,

escaped with honour from the bloody field of Crotona. On that
day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by the valour of
the Saracens⁸. These corsairs had indeed been driven by the Byzan-
tine fleets from the fortreffes and coasts of Italy 3 but a sense of in-

caliph of Egypt had transported forty thousand* Mossems to the aid
of his Christian ally. The successore of Bafil amused ‚themselves
with the belief, that the conquest of Lombardy had been atchieved‚
and was still preserved, by the justice of their laws, the virtues of
their ministers‚ and the gratitude of a people whom they had rescued
from anarchy and oppreffion. A series of rebellions might dart a ray

opulent cities: these cities were peopled with soldiers, artists, and
philosophers3 and the military strength of Tarentum, Sybaris, or
Crotona, was not inferior to that of a powerful kingdom. At the
