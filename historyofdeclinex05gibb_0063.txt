of the emperor solicited a treaty‚ which was almost accepted by the . ,, . ,

moderatiori of the Comnenian. But the former was betrayed by
his ambaffadors, and the latter was prevented by his friends. The
solitary Michael submitted to the voice of the people; the patriarch
annulled their oath of allegiance 3 and as he shaved the head of the
royal monk, congratulated his beneficial exchange of temporal royalty
for the kingdom of heaven: an exchange, however, which the priest,

drawn against the foreign and domestic enemies of the state. The
decline of his health and vigour suspended the operation of active
virtue; and the prospect of approaching death determined him to
interpose some momente between life and eternity. But instead of
leaving the empire as the marriage portion of his daughter, his
reason and inclination concurred in the preference of his brother
John, a soldier, a patriot, and the father of five sons, the future
pillars of an hereditary succeffion. His first modest reluctance might

and successful perseverance, however it may dazzle with the shew
of virtue, must be censured as a crimina] desertion of his duty, ‘and
a rare offence against his family and country. The purple which he
had refused was accepted by Constantine Ducas, a friend of the
Comnenian house, and whose noble birth was adorned with the
experience and reputation of civil poliey. In the monastic habit,
Isaac recovered his health, and survived two years his volunta-ry ab-
