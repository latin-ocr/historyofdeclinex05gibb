THE DECLINE AND FALL

fix miles to the north of Medina¹³²: the Koreish advanced in the
form of a crescent ; and the right wing of cavalry was led by Caled,
the fiercest and most successful of the Arabian warriors. The troops
of Mahomet were ss<ilfully posted on the declivity of the hill; and
their rear was guarded by a detachment of sifty archers. The
weight of their charge impelled and broke the centre of the idola-

from the ditch which was drawn before the city, and a camp of three
