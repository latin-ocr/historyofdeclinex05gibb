1f Constantine the eleventh were indeed the subject most worthy
of empire, we must pity the debasement of the age and nation in
which he was chosen. In the labour of puerile declamations he
fought, without obtaining, the crown of eloquence‚ more precious,
in his opinion, than that of Rome3 and, in the subordinate functions
of a judge, he forgot the duties of a sovereign and a warrior. Far
from imitating the patriotic indifference of the authors of his great-

Michael the seveuth, Andronicus the first, and Constantine the
twelfth, were invested‚ in a tender age, with the equal title of
Augustus; and the succession was speedily opened by their father’s
death. His widow, Eudocia, was entrusted with the administra-

to prote& his sons from the danger of her second nuptials; and her
solemn engagement, attested by the principal senators, was depofited

verity of the laws: his beauty and valour absolved him in the eyes
of the empress3 and Romanus, from a mild exile, was recalled on
the second day to the command of the Oriental armies. Her royal
choice was yet unknown to the public ; and the promise which
would have betrayed her falsehood and levity‚ was stolen by a dex-

alleged the sanffity of oaths and the sacred nature of a trust; but a
whisper, that his brother was the future emperor, relaxed his scru-
