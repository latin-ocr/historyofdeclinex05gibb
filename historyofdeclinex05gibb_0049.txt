ancients. An apartment of the Byzantine palace was lined with &afflff'fl’

porphyry: it was reserved for theuse of the pregnant empreffes ;
and the royal birth of their children was express'ed by the appellation.
of porphyrogenite, or born in the purple. Several of the Roman
princes had been bleffed with an heir; but this peculiar surname was
first applied to Constantine the seirenth. His life and titular reign were
of equal duration3 but of fifty-four y-ears, slX had elapsed before his
father's death3 and the son of Leo was ever the voluntary or reluCtam·

His uncle Alexander, who had long been invested with the tit-le os
Augustus, was the first colleague and governor of the young prince z

timely death, he entertained a proje& of castrating his nepheW, and
leaving the empire to a worthless favour-ite. The succeeding years of
the minority of Constantine were occupied by his mother Zoe, and a

he sailed from the mouth of the Danube into the harbour of Con-
stantinople‚ and was hailed as the deliverer of the people‚ and the
guardian of the prince. His supreme office was at first defined by
the new appellatIOn of father cf the emperor5 bnt Romanus soon
