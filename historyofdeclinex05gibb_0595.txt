and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to acknowledge their su-
premacy, and an ideal line from mount Garganus to the bay of
Salerno, leaves the far greater part of the kingdom of Naples under
the dominion of the Eastern. emp-ire. Beyond that line, the dukes
or republics of Amalfi⁵ and Naples, who had never forfeited their

produce and manufestiures of Afia. But the Lombard princes of

Benevento, Salerno, and Capua ⁶, were relu&antly torn from the
communion of the Latin world, and too often violated their oaths of
servitude and tribute. The city of Bari rose, to dignity and weahh,
as the metropolis of the new theme or province of Lombardy; the
title of patriciam, and afterwards the fingular name of Catapan ⁷, was

⁴ The original epistle of the emperor
Lewis ΙΙ. to the emperor Bafil, a curious re-
cord of the age, was first publiffied by Baro-

party about the same time, and Camillo Pelle-

grino (Script Rer.Ital.tom.ii. parsi. p. 285.)

style of the anonymous Chronicle. On the
rational ground of history and language,
Liutprand (p. 480.) had asserted the Latin
claim to Apulia and calabria..

Ducange (Κατεπαιω, catapanus), and his notes
on the Alexias (p. ²73·)· Against the con-
temporary notion, which derives it from
