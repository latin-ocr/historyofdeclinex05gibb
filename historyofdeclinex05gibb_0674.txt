of forty thousand horse ³³. His rapid and sscilful evolutions distrefl'ed

and dismayed the superior numbers of the Greek33 and in the de-
feat of Bafilacius, one of their principal generals, he displayed the
first example of his valour and clemency. The imprudence of the
emperor had separated his forces after the reduffion of Malazkerd.
It was in vain that he attempted to recal the mercenary Franks: they

the desertion of the Uzi filled his mind with anxiety and suspici0n5
and against the most salutary advice he rulhed forwards to speedy·
Had he listened to the fair proposals of the
sultam, Romanus might have seeured a retreat, perhaps a peace ; but
