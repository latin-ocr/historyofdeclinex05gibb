THE DECLINE AND FALL

C Η A P. Pyrenees, Abderame proceeded without delay to the paffage of the

Lu.

b—w—-v Rhone and the fiege of Arles. An army of Christians attempted

the relief of the city: the tombs of their leaders were yet vifible in
the thirteenth century; and many thousands of their dead bodies
were carried down the rapid stream into the Mediterranean sea.
The arms of Abderame were not less successful on the fide of the*-
ocean. He paffed without oppofition the Garonne and Dordogne5
which unite their waters in the gulf of Bourdeaux3 but he found,
beyond those rivers, the camp of the intrepid Eudes, who had
formed a second army, and sustained a second defeat, so fatal to the
Christians, that, according to their sad confeffion, God alone could
reckon the number of the ssain. The vietorious Saracen overran
the provinces of Aquitain, whose Gallie names are disguised, rather
than lost, in the modern appellations of Perigord, Saintonge, and
Poitou: his standards were planted on the walls, or at least before
the gates, of Tours and of Sens; and his detachments overspread
the kingdom of Burgundy as far as the well-known cities of Lyons
and Besancon. The memory of these devastations, for Abderame
did not spare the country or the people, was long preserved by tra-
dition3 and the invafion of France by the Moors or Mahometans,
affords the ground-work of those fables, which have been so wildly
dlsfigured in the romances of chivalry, and so elegantly adorned by
the Italian muse. In the decline of society and art, the deserted
cities could supply a ssender booty to the Saracens 3 their richest spoil
was found in the churches and monasteries, which they stripped of
their ornaments and delivered to the flames: and the tutelar saints,
both Hilary of Poitiers and Martia of Tours, forgot their miracu-
lous powers in the defence of their own sepulchres ²⁹. A vietorious
