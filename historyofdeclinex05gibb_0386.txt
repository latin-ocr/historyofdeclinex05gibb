gonist, he 'was convieted of vanity and falsehood ς and a fine of two
hundred thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty οι·
proved his rapaciousness. The unworthy treatment of Tarik was
revenged by a fimilar indignity; and the veteran commander, after
a public whipping, stood a whole day in the sun before the palace
gate, till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious name of a pil-
grimage to Mecca. The resentrnent of the caliph might have been
satiated with the ruin of Musa 3 but his fears demanded the extirpa-
tion of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death was inti-
mated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of the throne
both in Africa and Spain3 and the forms, if not the substance, of
justice were superseded in this bloody execution. ln the mosch or
palace of Cordova, Abdelaziz was ssain by the swords of the con-
spirators; they accused their governor of claiming the honours of
royalry3 and his scandalous marriage with Egilona, the widow of

spair of Musa raised him above the power of kings; and he expired
at Mecca of the anguish of a broken heart. His rival was more
favourably treated : his services were forgiven 3 and Tarik was per-
mitted to mingle with the crowd 'of ssaves ¹⁸⁹. I am ignorant whe-
