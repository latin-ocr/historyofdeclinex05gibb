dice, the gates of heaven will be open to both sexes ; but Mahomet has C HI A P·

not specified the male companions of the female eleC’c, lest he should ...w-,0
either alarm the jealousy of their former hufflands, or disturb their

felicity, by the suspicion of an everlasting marriage. This image of
a carnal paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the envy, of ’
the monks: they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet ;

and his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures
and allegories. But the founder and more eonfistent party adhere‚
without simule, to the literal interpretation of the Koran : useless
would be the resurrection of the body, unless it were restored to the
poffeffion and exercise of its worthiest faculties ; and the union of sen-
sual and intellectual enjoyment is requifite to complete the happiness
of the double animal, the perse& man. Yet the joys' of the Maho-
metan paradise will not be confined to the indulgence of luxury and
appetite3 and the prophet has expressly declared‚ that all meaner
happiness will· be forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs,
who shall be admitted to the beatitude of the divine vifion ¹¹⁰.
