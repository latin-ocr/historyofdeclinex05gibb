u--v——v usurpation5 and the revolt of Gregory was the claim Of his lawful

inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debr of gratitude3
and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no more than the
just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty portion of the ecclesiasti-
cal state. The sovereignty of Rome no longer depended on the
choice ofa fickle people; and the successbrs of St. Peter and Con-
stantine were invested with the purple and prerogatives of the Caesars.
So deep was the ignorance and credulity of the times, that the most
absurdrof fables was received, with equal reverence, in Greece and in
Franco, and is still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law ⁷⁰.
The emperors, and the Romans, were incapable of discerning a for-
gery, that subverted their rights and freedom ; and the only oppo-
sirion proceeded from a Sabine monastery, which, in the beginning
of the twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of the dona-
tion of Constantine ⁷¹. In the revival of letters and liberty this
fictitious deed was transpiereed by the pen of Laurentius Valla, the
pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot⁷'. His contem-

which Laurentius Valla recites and refutes,
appears to be taken either from the spurious
Acts of St. silvester or from Gratian’s De-

it has been surreptitioussy tacked.

that Benediffine abbey. They were formerly
acceffible to curious foreigners (Le Blanc and

Mabillon), and would have enriched the first ,

volume of the Historia Monastica ltaliae of

the future cardinal yielded to the voice of
authority and the whispers of ambition (Qi-

p. 734—780.), this animated discourse‚ which
was composed by the author, A. D. 1440, fix
