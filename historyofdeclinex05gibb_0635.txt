OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. 623

rose ina furious tumult; and an hasty word of the conqueror, in C ILTV? Ρ·
his defencc or rcvenge, was the signal of fire and pillage⁸⁶. The nav—1
Saracens of Sicily, the subjecls of Roger, and auxiliaries of his bro-
ther, embraced this fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy
city of the Christians: many thousands of the citizens, in the fight,
and by the allies, of their spiritual father, were exposed to violation,
captivity, or death3 and a spacious quarter of the city, from the
Lateran to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted

to perpetual solitude ⁸⁷. From a city, where he was now hated, and

might be no longer feared, Gregory retired to end his days in the
palace of Salerno. The artful pontiff might fiatter the vanity of
Guiscard, with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown3 but this
dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the ambition of the
Norrnan, must for ever have alienated the most faithful princes of

chief (inde quibusdam aedibus exustis), which
is again exaggerated in some partial Chro—
nieles (Muratori Annali, tom. ix. p. 147.)-

⁸⁷ After mentioning this devastation, the
Jesuit Donatus (de Roma veteri et nova, l. iv.
c. 8. p. 489.) prettily adds, Duraret ho-
dieque in Coelio monte interque ipsum et ca-
pitolium miserabilis facies prostratae urbis,
nisi in hortorum vinetorumque amaenitaeem

Roma resurrexisset ut perpetua viriditate con·
tegeret vulnera et ruinas suas.

or bestowed byshc pope (Anna, 1. i. p. 32),
is sufficiently confirmed by the Apulian (l.iv.
p. 270.)-
