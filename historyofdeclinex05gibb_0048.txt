44 THE DECLINE AND FALL

Cxffvstll‘· and state3 that his education had been directed by the learned Pho-

ι-ψ-μ tius; and that several books of profane and ecclefiastical science
were composed by the pen, or in the name, os the Imperial philrfi- θ
pher. But the reputation of his philosophy and religion was over-
thrown by a domestic vice, the repetition of his nuptials. The pri-
mitive ideas of the merit and holiness of celibacy, were preached by
the monks and entertained by the Greeks. Marriage was allowed
as a necessary means for the propagation of mankind ; after the
death of either party, the survivor might satissy by a second union,
the weakncss or the strength of the flesh ε but a third marriage was
censured as a state of legal fornication; and a fourth was a sm or
scandal as yet unknown to the Christians of the East. Inrthe be-

bines, and condemned, without annulling, third marriages: but his
patriotism and love soon compelled him to violate his own laws, and
to incur the penance, which in a similar case he had imposed on
his subjens. In his three first alliances, his nuptial bed was un-
fruitful ; the emperor required a female companion, and the empire
a legitimate heir. The beautiful Zoe was introduced into the palace
as a concubine3 and after a trial of her fecundsty, and the birth of

Constantine, her lover declared his intention of legitimating the
mother and the child, by the celebration of his fourth nuptials. But
the patriarch Nieholas refused his blessing: theImperial baptism of

the young prince was obtained by a promise of separation 3 and the
contumacious husband of Zoe was excluded from the communion
of' the faithful. Neither the sear of exile, nor the desertion of his
bretlnen, nor the authority of the Latin church, nor the danger of
failure or doubt in the succeffion to the empire, could bend the
spirit of the inssexible monk. After the death of Leo, he was re-
called from exile to the civil and eeclesiastical administrati0u3 and
