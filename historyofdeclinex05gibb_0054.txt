ῳ who had placed the crown on his head: by his second nuptials he
ineurred a year of canonical penance ; a bar of spiritual affinity
was opposed to their celebration; and some evaslon and perjury

the emperor's brother, he was degraded from the office of general
of the East, to that of direecor of the. posts, and his murmura were
chastised with disgrace and exile. Eut Zimisces was ranked among
the numerous lovers of the empress: ou her interceffion, he was per-
mitted to reside at Chalcedon, in the neighbourhood of the capital:
her bounty was repaid in his clandestine and amorous vifits to the
