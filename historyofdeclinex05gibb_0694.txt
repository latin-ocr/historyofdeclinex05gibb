THE DECLINE AND FALL

the zeal of pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times:
and the roads vvere covered with multitudes of either sex, and of
every rank, who p1·ofeffed their contempt of life, so soon as they
should have kiffed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and prelates
abandoned the care of their dominions3 and the numbers of these

pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which marched in the·
ensuing age under the banner of the cross. About thirty years be-

fore the first crusade, the archbilhop of Mem, with the bishops of
Utrecht‚ Bamberg, and Radibon, undertook this laborious journey
from the Rhine to the Jordan3 and the multitude of their followers
amounted to seven thousand persons. At Constantinople‚ they vvere
hospitably entertained by the emperor ; but the ostentation of their
wealth provoked the affault of the wild Arabs; they drew their
swords with scrupulous relufflnce, and sustained a siege in the vil-
lage of Capernaum, till they were rescued by the venal proteffion
of the Fatimite emir. After vifiting the holy places, they embarked
for Italy, but only a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety in
their native land. Ingulphus, a secretary of William the conqueror,
was a compartion of this pilgrimage: he observes that they sallied
from Normandy, thirty stout and well-appointed horsemen3 but

that they repaffed the Alps, twenty miserable palmers, with the staff
in their hand, and the wallet at their back ⁷².

After the defeat of the Romans, the tranquillity of the Fatimite

caliphs was invaded by the Turks⁷³. One of the lieutenants of
Malek Shah, Atfiz the Carizmian, marched into Syria at the head of

a powerful army, and reduced Damascus by famine and the sword„

Heme, and the other cities of the province, acknowledged the caliph
of Bagdad and the sultan of Perfia3 and the victorious emir ad·-
